303,wow okay  when you're finished when she's done  okay  thank you  how are you doing today okay how about yourself  here in California  all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of  I'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here  traffic Maybe  the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis  sociology I have a  2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology  no I'm actually MTA bus operator  what's your  well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature  thanks  well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean I'm sorry  okay  free take a long walk hot bath  meditate just close my eyes sometimes  okay  I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time  well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated  I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today  I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the  life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but  my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family  thank you  no  set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home  well  by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature  I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old  yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time  yeah thank you  the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and  they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can  with my kids or Just.  what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me  thank you  happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week  thank you  well device I would have gave myself  then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that  I probably wouldn't  stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know  whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career  I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so  yes  my oldest daughter  we had an argument because  the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though  is true or  or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but  lettuce happened you know  I just told her my I'm sorry  very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life  and I've been  she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change  how hot is it  it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but  the ball is in her Court you know  only can do so much  oh wow  Oh my days  since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest because it kind of like  it it kind of like I guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know  pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me  what am I like irritated tired lazy  you know  feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep  never thought about that you know  cuz like I said you know everybody had a moment to do  I thought about that  no  no  okay  how your best friend describe you I don't really have a best friend but person that I deal with it I used to work with she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing a go-getter Dependable responsible  I'm a people person  I get along with others you know I'm kind of like  I live in a good Mark  whether I know you are not if you was to you know like like you and I now you know I I I  you probably sell she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that  thank you  well  I try to stay happy I rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what I mean  especially when I go to pick him up from school or just up to me  thank you  you're more than welcome you have a good day  goodbye  you're welcome  okay  that is so interesting,0

I really don't like that  yeah so but I mean we're fine now  so that's good  tonight  believe people so easily  so gullible is not be so gullible  I guess I've been hearing that lately how I believe anybody anything that somebody says about really thinking about it or without having them prove it so I guess you can say I made a lot of mistakes I don't regret it because I'm glad I went through while younger than me even older and going to the same situation so  yeah I believe people too easily and I get people to his chances  so yeah  when I went on a cruise would you have experience when I went on a cruise to Mexico with my family when I was 16 by 6 years ago  yeah I mean yeah I guess  no I really want you though  trying new things singing new views of the world I'm trying a different type of foods seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there I guess  yeah I plan to go to the Bahamas next year I find a lot of traveling last year actually  just pretty good  omelette  I'm tired and I kind of fall asleep during class and what not  do you feel that way often yeah is my fault though  probably today  or I fell asleep late so it's my fault  I'm not so pretty happy right now  no no  no  how do your best friend  very friendly and funny  talkative through High School  I'm pretty close we'll try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week I'll try to see them at least every few months  they're everywhere no comment off of that earn back in a day they are learning their very progressing but when it comes to technology or not outside our nature or about the little things in life ages yeah but when it comes to the mentality they are getting smarter cuz the schools are getting better I ain't going to lie so  when what happened  last weekend I guess  I'd love to hear all about it  right now  I'm being on my boyfriend makes me really happy so I was just hanging out with him last weekend and I never really get to see him that much so yeah cuz he works fast School different schedules  not that bad  how do you know that  he's my boyfriend I've been knowing him for about 6 months now  we met through a mutual friend in La I guess  awesome  okay  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me you're welcome  but I'll be right there so I wasn't sure if that was part of it or not,6

So being outdoors and I've always enjoyed being outdoors that's how I like being a truck driver I've traveled the world I don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office I'm more of a  outdoors type of guy show  I'd like to hear about one of your trips  one of my trips would be  I spent a year-and-a-half in Japan and on the lower Island there that they built that bridge the largest bridge in the world  I wonder to work for  for an all-white a lot and all white tiger act and working for JP circus shows interesting that a lot of people that Island hadn't really seen a lot of Americans that was one of the islands also that we that they bombed so it was a lot of negativity but I probably have a good behavior and all those times that you know I  I enjoyed my shopping out for all the traveling and meeting new people and you know different Universe foods and  can you get experience for me all that whole experience was pretty good for traveling around the circus  ingrate nice  I really like about ale  probably  I want some of things I like about that way there's not a lot that I like but I don't like but I like Hollywood I like to eat the movie industry  the huge show  different different piano different  different ethnics of people here in Ohio  I enjoy talking to you if you know a lot of foreigners so you know I'd like to see where it came from and what what it's like there  yes  traffic cirrhosis  yeah  what are some things that make you really mad  traffic ignorance  being disrespectful being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful towards you or other people  okay or I if I'm riding my bike people tend to almost from yours or if I'm not totally paying attention to traffic and all I find myself sometimes  you don't happen to wait to see what they're going to do instead of I have in the right away or stuff like that  yeah big time  what do you do when you're annoyed  what do I do when I'm annoyed  price and third shifter and vent and speak my mind even though I myself wishing that I carried rocks in my back pocket so I can let you know what happened so much where I I just  if it makes me what people will do some time with me oh you almost get run over all you know how I fight almost get run over probably on a daily basis  and I wouldn't mind attention right  how hard is that a try not to react to your reactions  yeah  when was the last time you argue with them  it was my girlfriend and it was about being honest  I'm pretty honest with  I'm open and honest about it anything and everything and what it was about was just her lying to me telling me that she had told our landlord something and I know she done something in that in that aspect and I come to find out a week later that it it was a total why I fell and I just  damn I got it all  yeah  how did you feel in that moment  transducer the word for it  just said I don't know now that whether I can be there because it was  I felt hurt and all that you know it would have been in a relationship for a little bit and that's probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest  I don't like I said I don't hold back on for y'all in anything and everything that I do or say so and if you're lying about something and Wall-E just your always having to cover up  more lies with the lies that mean that you already told him I  I don't see any kind of  took a lot from me trusting her now and I'll or whatever now I'm like you know it's like truthful with it not know it was going to hurt our relationship  volume  what are some things you like to do for fun  fun  by going to the beach  Russian dark but haven't done it in a while I love the paint I got in the watercolor painting and pretty gifted at that and  I want to try some other mediums and let me see you I love fishing  I haven't gone in a while though  I like driving truck no more and my job are you I wasn't really really enjoyed it I don't like driving through cities but I usually when I'm in the middle of the night when she all the star light star gazing I'll see if I can pick out some of those astronomy start off the affair and  I'm a pretty easygoing guy so shooting pool  sunshine  most memorable experiences  good or bad  whatever comes to your mind  most memorable experiences  I'll probably  playing with lions and tigers  wrestling a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle  I just enjoy myself  awesome  not  I don't have much family as it is  at least here in the states I don't know miles from Central America so but I'm not close to I have  three brothers one sister  and I'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings I speak with one brother  quite a bit my other youngest brother and I just rather not know you're not this guy try to keep it on a professional basis my sister I don't talk to her at all my other brother underneath me I haven't spoken to him in years. I'm just close my mom my knees some of my nephews and that's about it  okay can you have done anything to avoid it  have I done anything to avoid it  to avoid them  yeah I just don't talk to my don't call my phone ask about on my you know I talked to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but I just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up I just know that's on them and I really don't want to do it himself  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last  going on a year  you know I I I  depends on my thought process at time I liked it I've been looking for work quite a bit so I was just wondering why you know I don't get called I I just have I have racing thoughts  so  or I get depressed you know cuz I are worried about things that you know that really I have no control over so you know  lately I just been sleeping too much for me because I was so used to just sleeping 4 to 5 hours a night too and now it's changed about 8 to 9 hours and I'm still tired  do you feel that way often lately I have them for about the last few months  what are you like when you don't sleep well tired  you know I don't sleep well you know that I just do all back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know I'm more of a guy and I love the work  and if I'm not then I just looked too much time for me to spend in my own head and so  you know  either I'll even if I'm busy I'm doing what I need to do know and whatever job I do like, you know get into it I enjoy it something new for me and  so I can think about you know either work or I can go home and then think about this you know I don't have to worry about no money  your bill is getting paid and I can just concentrate on other things either you know doing the things I like or maybe spending a little more time with my girlfriend or you know so  how do you cook with them  how do I cover them  I just  try not to think about it as it's not about what are coping with it or not I just do is  I'm a horrible guy that just  you know I may take me a moment to  to all  Salem cooking something but you know how it is if I have no control over it there's nothing that I can really do about it. One thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing and that's actively looking for work. Going out on interviews talking with others about work so I can just come out and I'll get back to  back to basics you know I just don't like the loss of balme does bother me but I try not to  to let it continue bother me  yes  that got me a  if what has got me in trouble  my mood choice I mean  yeah money I mean my past I got a past history so which kind of tends to  ibobber my my hiring process I don't know them when I get hired so I got to do it a different different type of employers who are felony friendly and stuff like that and I tried you know I was out taking classes on now  oh not how to interview how to how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and  I got to reflect back on that but I just I got to keep putting in my head if that's not who who I want to be anymore so or you know I've done  I've done now  I've done my time so to say but I took the time you know the last time I just took a lot of time in and try to work on  the issues that were bothering me LOL  positive stuff I got my GED two different things to a lot of classes thought about going to school and going to school and  anything that would cause I change my old ways and and and try to move on to more productive activities  that's good  are you still in here  that  people have been deceitful  can you repeat that one more time  have you been diagnosed with depression been diagnosed with bipolar  how hard is that  stopping me don't you know  I don't medicate so I mean I have been on medication before in the past but  I guess I try to live on while I try to live life on life's terms and I just you know I know the medical establishment always want to label something in and what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills and I've been on probably every magical feel that there is for that and  you know how long I've been too strong or something that's coming up and so I just try to cope with things  which is my life skills you know I I don't I don't want to be using probably I know certain drugs work for like 3 to 4 months 6 months and they go load it while I'm going to try on this phone or I'm going to try on that and it's just an ongoing process tonight probably for about the last two years ask about three years I can kind of just said you know what that's it  and I  what are the difference in whether or if I would be on meds for it I don't think so you know it's just still the same stuff I still get the same problem can I still get the same anxiety that's if I if I was on medication for it or not so I just  and I'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good and I get irritated at people a lot I don't like people I don't like crowds I don't like I'm not just people and empty quiet so  but I got a pretty nice not that I personality but I think people can see me and just say I don't mess with this guy or you know  but she'll you know I like I all right public transportation quite a bit and  now you just get a lot of loud I'm not just people on there sometimes I got to get off the bus that's how I deal with people because I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way. Go I'd rather take the time on get off the bus wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad  I understand  did you think you have a phone before you come back  did I have problem before I get out  well I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out the thing is that I know other people  I have a lot of the same town so I know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when I told him that I was diagnosed with bipolar that  a lot of remorse for like all that's what you know that's what was wrong with you know we wish you that you would have found that out years ago  and like I said I don't think the meds really work but what I do I think time, I just getting older kind of makes it work  median with lights  how do you say therapist affected you  how do I talk to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while recently  and I don't want to get out my anger my thoughts  a lot of people other people may not understand  a therapist is  I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out whatever is problem it would be  people in Ohio  other issues you don't work or whatever the case maybe is that I just think talking about it and they're such good listener thinking, like  now that they give me the same advice I give myself or whatever that I would give to others but it's always helpful to hear from somebody else somebody who suppose we have to go to school for  I don't go anymore so I kind of miss it you know like I said  Miss Mulatto  I just one of those things you know I just deal with it you know according to let you know if I ever get a chance to go to therapy again. Charlottsville all monetary reasons and  and all I don't have health insurance and there's a lot of things that you know I like to do but I can't  the money situation is not that great right now so  I'm sorry  how does my friends describe me  they would probably describe me as a  energetic outgoing person once I get to know people  laugh I know Apple I laugh a lot  but  it would probably tell you that I'm also very serious and and  hidden person I don't reveal a lot  positive influence in your life  Domino's menu  I'll probably my boss one of my bosses when I first trailer with a  what exotic animals he was real and he was  German and  Bennigan's  he don't know what he saw in me but  he talked a lot about working with exotic animals and  show a lot of confidence in man with your engine and also build confidence in myself and  sort of let me know that you know this is nothing that I really can accomplish if I put my mind to it  okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye  she said good-bye and then  we just have a quick postcode for you",7

So let me know.  thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend I don't judge I can I'm a computer I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you I'll ask a few questions to get it started and please feel  your answers  where are you from originally  Moscow  vitamins for life my family move to the US and then I moved down here eventually for college  how easy was it for you to get used to  long time to leave the money here for about a year since I graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though that's good  how do you like your living situation. I have two roommates and there's a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year in a couple months I think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality TV show for a while  how do you know the ones from college and the other one I found on Craigslist  how close are you to that varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so I just pretty cuz  right now I kind of distant  tell me more about that event the distance  okay, well we haven't seen each other around hung out in like 2 weeks cuz one of them got into like with car accident and so she's been distant since 10 and kind of locks herself up in her room  and the other one is always working late so we are scheduling has been off and the ones we made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone I guess to make the first move  yeah that sucks it's okay  how are you at controlling your temper  it depends with whom  I'm dealing with I guess I would say it was them people I guess is my family's not very good my boyfriend is not very good but with other people that I might not know so well then I'm able to control little bit more but I'll do a little more passive aggressive rather than my full on anger  Sonic songs  Houston has been a positive influence in your life  she's probably been she's been we've been best friends for High School freshman year of high school when we first mom  give me an example of that  as of what  how do you know that my friend to call we met in French class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kind of surgeon homework together and we had a lot of cloud the same classes together and so you can send Hangouts and then we just became closer and stay really close since then  what are some things you like to do for fun at going out with friends and the bar is going dancing biking hiking staying active then the movies playing at Cedar Restaurant stop tography  was hanging out with friends I guess whatever okay  how close are you to your family and various like I'm really close to them when it comes to things of a like schoolwork those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things I don't really discuss that with them  Vegas superficially Club  but I rely on them a lot so what by guess  what are some things that make you really mad  I guess it depends who it is again I guess people who are in considerate and thoughtful flaky ignorant and  yeah and get those kinds of people and then people just and it's a lot of things that people react to different situations can make me angry I guess  when was the last time you argue with someone and what was it about my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money and so so finding that when he doesn't see the orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not very healthy and so I got frustrated with him cuz I'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and that each time he was going to do it when you do it then he doesn't phase consulate breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry people who don't follow through  yeah  do you feel that way often  about other people about myself or angry  whatever comes to your mind  angry I am so glad that now I don't feel angry often  okay  what's your dream job  that is a tough one how about getting paid to leave me now that's kind of what I'm going to figure out right now cuz I quit my full-time job because I hated it as opposed to sitting in an office all day which I thought was extremely boring so now I work in a restaurant job and I'm too old for a second job to support myself my dream job  I don't know what it would be but I know it involves people and I'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment turns band and yet there's something I realized I like to see  the result from all my hard work cuz I majored in sociology and as much as I love that major it's you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing in arguing but with no real solution such as like as a and that's all you have is just being theoretical element that you can't do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or no people amazing artistic I love photography I love cooking baking and particularly so I know something  and that  Mom I guess okay  you travel a lot I used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to 578 different countries I've lived in three or four different countries I haven't traveled a lot lately just because I have no money and jobs kind of tie you down but I would love to have that is my dream job would be a photographer for National Geographic that would be awesome or a food photographer that traveled but anyways you enjoy about traveling  in the new places near faces and experiences I get Restless very easily it says nice of conflict be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine I hate the routine and Monday mass of everyday life is so it's nice to  does things.  I want to hear about one of your trips  okay  tennis tank mermaid trips  I have begun talking about I don't know what's funny even though I've been to lots of different country is one of my most memorable memorable trips as one of the trips I took with my family is a three-week road trip with my family this five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon but it was really fun and even though I've traveled so many places I realize that there's like such a beauty and the American landscape and so we were all around this house last in the Grand Canyon to Zion to the Grand Tetons to Yellowstone and it's absolutely amazing to sing about natural beauty is so and it's a grizzly bear black bear the Bison sounds really cool natural wonders also really miss me cuz those things aren't men made as as pretentious as it sounds after while you're kind of gets old but it's like and I guess the same way  white old white man building great buildings in artwork and yeah I see what you mean  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I want  pretty easy as long as I  get supply I sleep so easy  what are you like when you don't sleep well grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much I just kind of offer in my own world you feel that way often anymore I usually get enough sleep and I've been working out more so it's not too bad that's good  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  I haven't just been one negative but I have to do it by circumstances kind of like spend about almost 5 months since I quit my full-time job haven't found anything else boyfriend interested in so  Esmeralda's like what am I doing that I did that kind of thing  can be talked about a good job these days it is higher than market and looks like I'm very picky because I don't want to just sit in a little my own Cuba fault if I quit my job exactly for that reason why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that I quit my other job so it looks like I have to make it worthwhile that I quit my last job to get a better job as a kind of like stuck in this section of like living paycheck-to-paycheck barely making it just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when did I give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world and spitting and we'll keep a cold I don't know when does that same situation after college so but I guess it's tough cuz a lot of my friends so they went to a pretty good school and you not have a friend his teaching English in Afghanistan  Teach for America and their friends in Hartford at schools like Harvard Matthew not getting her master's that's kind of like  got that comparison and then here I am with you in a little restaurant job so  do you feel down  I do sometimes yes but I'm going to Hawaii next week so right now I'm fine yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because I'm just trying to find like what I'm supposed to do you not like what I want to do next and my money situations are just very stressful as a school loan to pay off Insurance rent car loans like ants the groceries but I can't even afford groceries it's just hard to live this way specially after we paid so much money for amazing cause education so frustrating but there's a lot of people the same situation  turn down  have you been diagnosed with depression I don't think so but I mean I think everyone goes through depression here now so I don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose I'm not on meds okay have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD  okay  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  oh that's to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail cuz I'm one of those people from not going to be the best at something and I'm not going to try except the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but I didn't get them told my high school self that don't try lots of things even if it means I'm not going to be the best at it about 10 years ago made me like 12 so  I used to do a lot of things but I used to ask and it got to continue doing that I used to write a lot when I was younger I used to write miniature like little sorry sorry sorry it's for my parents all the time and I kind of stopped doing those things cuz it's like I'm not good at it so I'm not going to do it I just continue doing those things and tried sneaking out of classes and I'm no different sports soccer growing up I don't know just expand my sophomore rather than likely I'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder cuz like I said I was going to say that one that was like once I'm good I just stay for good and I'll try that go about that that monster Newsom  yeah  what do you do to relax  all right now it's super lame but I watch TV but I used to read of mice to read on my off-time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake bananas like since I'm on my feet all day and like consol interacting with people I just kind of want to unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and be like I'm done  which one of your most memorable experience  the top question  I'm probably the day I got accepted into Pomona College it was a freshman at Wellesley College courses that woman called back and I hated it from Mike II from like the first week I just knew that I chose the wrong College not like miserable for the entire year and I only apply to one school of the transfer Pomona College by steps at in Clermont and  anime how can I get in and I also because there's like a 4% acceptance rate and if I go to the chances like this is ridiculous I don't think we can get in and I'll let you know the thought of going back to sleep but then I got an email from one of the admissions counselors that I had met when I was visiting Pomona and he's like I talk to you I just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about Pomona hope all is well and I was like why are you telling me the day we find out if we got you next that's it or not unless I got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later I got the email that I was accepted into Pomona and I was like my best day of my life so happy cuz I want ya and I text my mom and my little brother  hair pierce my dad's I was like let's start this whole thing over  how do your best friend describe you  The Voice  fine  maybe Moody you never know what you're going to get sometimes  probably  definitely friendly like a positive person  but sometimes maybe a little bit  aggressive  the most practicing positive things I mean she's my best friend

I mean my wife left like 3 weeks ago so yes  it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done so yeah  well considering I'm only 19 if I could go back 19 years I would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife and not to be angry  yeah driving away my wife  gas mini many things every day every day  I could have not broken stuff  and I could have a  stop the Legos basically blocking out the external universe and I was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that I don't focus on the real life I was basically escaping until tonight since I wasn't paying attention to her and that's basically why she left that mean that I'm being angry is like both contributed their own portion  earlier today  I mean I feel really happy all the time and then it just goes away it's like back and forth like one day on one side and I'll be really happy and then another second I'll be really sad cuz I'll think about some onion and I got to keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like thinking  I really know how to explain it it's just something you feel  know any better programming  silly  I'm creative potential of intelligence  charming and loving  at some point, all those things at some point.

310,yes it's okay  Vine  I live in Hollywood  Seattle  it's kind of a vague question  the exchange of scenery  I like traveling by train that's on my favorite thing  because I don't fly I can't stand airplane so I prefer trains  what the fly on an airplane  probably December of 1986 or 87  nothing much to tell really my news I just go from La up to Seattle in 02 Vancouver that's probably the main thing I do train  not very often once every 5 years or so  oh yeah sure absolutely  depends on what it is that I'm annoyed by give me anything in defense  depends on whether it's  at something or someone you know if it's a someone I mean I don't I don't I don't get physical towards me but I mean I mean that what they've done to piss me off I'm not above shouting at them for whatever reason so  depends  in terms of lashing out at other people physically I don't do that but in order to let off some aggression different if need be all I'm not above you know  punching a wall or punching something nearby I mean I'm not trying to  this is love doesn't physically hurt me but you don't just get some steamed Red Lobster lost email that's normal for me  face to face  can remember it's been a long time  but I mean I argue about with people online about stupid shit Tina that's that's normal ship as far as like face-to-face chance for a long time  currently or overall  which one means someone I'm in contact with now or someone from maybe for my pastor which is it  okay my mom had a  boyfriend I was a teenager he was like a father figure out when I was about 14 so he was pretty positive influence  not at all  to open up a record shop  unemployed office worker right now  as in what doing what you must Pacific  going on a first date with a girlfriend back in the 2007 Emmy first met  Smead arrangements to meet her and her daughter and her daughters friends at the Queen Mary Long Beach and you'll have spent the evening this time of the day to evening together and hanging out and eat dinner and stayed at the hotel one I got to know each other that way  it wasn't  well we were that was beginning of a relationship at the time so it was that's how I knew where my girlfriend at the time so  currently yeah I do here  I don't it sucks balls I hate having roommates sucks  in some ways it's okay cuz I don't see me that much as I'm not really around them and the other times I need I need to have my own space and also difficult for me that way we get we get along but I don't really see them that much that's by Design so  like to be alone sometimes I read that this mean that I'd like to be alone  hey ladies doing nothing since defense  no  no  no  sorry you repeat that  no not necessarily  very I'm a heavy sleeper  I don't know that would call it down but I'm not necessarily what you would called  Siri but I don't know what I miss the way down  yeah all the time  how to say I don't know I'm not sure  I don't know that I really want the one to ask a guy to get his ass someone else about that I have a difficult time answering that question  out of  I didn't didn't fall the drugs like a lot of other people that I know  listening Music On Vinyl  being around dogs  spend New Year's Eve with a friend real close friend  not really  I'm glad I don't have any I think they're especially here in Los Angeles they drive me nuts I can't stand them  I assume you mean post High School  I briefly just sick basica General Studies I from I remember I actually didn't finish that quit to play the band so I did I skipped a lot of school so I didn't really  so nothing you're the Junior College Community College says I didn't go to university so I was just  do what  stop going  I just wasn't interested in my interests were elsewhere so I just I just going  in terms of what  I'm sure everyone has a right or something you know I'm not going to get specific but yeah sure things I regret year  20 years ago what was that  93  well 10 years ago 2003  it's hard to say it's hard to say  pick up the comeback to that with maybe  I don't have a best friend these days  volume depends on your definition of friend that I don't I don't hang out with me people you know it I had best I had a so-called best friend you out but that was like  20 years 20 some odd years ago and I don't really I'm very much a loner these day so that I don't really have what you would consider a tester a really close friend you know I just don't have that  okay  Sia,4
312,that should I move my arms around  and I'm going to start at 10  if it's not it was said don't answer that make sense  I don't ask that that's all okay that's all.  Okay  impressive  are you okay  yes  fine how about you  here  yes  the weather  weather mainly near the met the weather sorry  not the people put some of the people stuff like that so  okay I'm cutting you off  not as much as I used to  I used to be in school they sell a lot of places for conferences think that that put me out of school right now but later I'll get back into school. Shelmore right now  I don't  I don't enjoy traveling  ask a question that's pretty good all I study Physics and it's mainly  Ashley  run out east Community College physics and astronomy research and physics also because I like the type of thing I want me to Grass will hopefully that's why I'm nervous sometime from the questionnaire  impressive  professor at a place like USC or UCLA it's not that where the professors do three hours work a week in the grasses to the rest  you're actually pretty good at this  I got this lot of people the first one I guess is my physics teaching AP Physics tutoring high school even though you just let me to be Engineers have a physics major he still was a very good if what he told me you know he's fertile tell me that  school is not about a grave about learning  okay  oh pretty good I think  I'm single so I don't get too many arguments but it's part of my brother about  hiddleswift to play a video game together I know I'm pretty old for this  really close a sedum praealtum pair to see a couple times a week older try to help me with groceries things iPad and a brother I see same same same old same time my sister I tutor her kids my nephew's so I see him but once we go so  yes  because I spend long. Of time doing math and reading and not talking anybody message.  I guess I play video games or it'll work out I work out I think a lot I try to at least  I rolled my eyes which happened towards a bad thing and let's put it I think  bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more than themselves and representations and the kids just do they won't be compared to Art their opinion  I guess  thank you  I only have best friend  it's a remember  unbiased obviously but they are  I really good math I'm not really sure if you can't that's why you can't get better than that but thing is it's just have to get recertified conference with it where no matter what it is going to learn in math class. Out I am patient I think and I am just went where I can swim I can spend many hours many many many hours would be books that might not be important but they might be important to do anyway that's a bad thing  when I a good workout  Google video game small little things like that when something happens when my not researched I think mathematical physics type thing where it goes well that must put a book that puts me in a good mood  thank you  right now  is it that that  research that I did I did make it this far  research why that's all  that's all  interesting  we start off in school read about I say things like that he's a general tutoring hero particle physics and no idea what it is you know it's very complicated because iCloud mechanics and you still have that and but you not sure if I should make it and eventually he still has lot of time goes by you reach you as time goes on you can get closer closer emission Mexico I miss you realize you are just men as good as we are up there you can do research and visit you can't admit knowledge  okay  a few weeks ago when I got a good grade in the class  thank you  yes briefly  many years ago  I don't know she's always growing up I always thought I was always thought Dreamworld the kid that's why and I just we're not doing that  I was National Guard or I think about 18 19 I got commissioned at2021 as longing for about a year so I let it 2022  yes. Really  I don't think it did I think I just need to grow up your butt or expecting to be as much  graduate school  in physics  no  nope  it depends when I work out really hard at night of the day of the day before if I work out pretty hard as bad if I don't workout it I don't know it's hard moderately  thank you  yes  it's okay  probably like I am now normal I think not as not as happy about everything was still pretty okay still function  no  hey sliding  no  yes  yes I have changed my thoughts  applying to grad school games been a while and slightly apprehensive happy that looks good but every answer is that it might not be good things like that  what do you mean by that is I know so you could Peter but I didn't how hard to do these thoughts or how hard is it going to grad school  understand  okay  I agree  no not really  how to keep doing what you do even though I'm not that old believe it or not 20 years ago was probably 15 kit for 12 workout if I work if it was a little bit different don't think it'll work out so well it was a perfect now they were doing really well personally  thank you  same here  goodbye  I'll keep this on  take us off now,2
313,that shows you that  who started the virtual human and she's going to chat with you for a bit and then she's good when she finishes them to give you the doorbell so you can let me know  Lexi  are you okay  sure  okay I guess not bad not good  so so  Denver Colorado  to pursue job opportunities  about 2 years ago  once or twice a year  I really like the sunshine all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do  that sort of thing  I hate the traffic  I wish the seasons were more distinct and everything cost a lot of money here  pretty easy  say  people are rude  not having enough money  what else  just a lot of things are frustrating I guess  I guess it depends on what I'm annoyed about like that another person or about something I did or just life in general  if somebody like a person and always me I'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop  that what you're talking about  so so not not as good as I'd like to be  a few days ago about getting paid for something I did on time  pretty pissed off taken advantage of  I like to go to the gym  hang out with friends read right sort of thing  at times  because sometimes I like to keep to myself and don't feel like showing what about word emotion  I have a degree in in Liberal Arts major in political science  I work in sales  209  several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams  guess that's a job  I used to live in Mexico City that was pretty memorable  how much is pretty different than anything I've ever experienced a lot of fun supposed to lot of new things and new people is pretty young and carefree Good Times  not recently but I have in my life traveled quite a bit  Marseille  I went to London has lot of fun pretty cool City little too expensive but definitely cool  of what does anything in life  what's good question  moving tellabs pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to move here so that was memorable I would say  maybe like  6 months ago  things are just going really well  didn't have much stress in my life  I'm easier more easily irritated and  yell more tired more  kind of down feeling down more  not as productive  yeah while ago  don't exactly it's been a few years but I still feel the same as I did when they diagnosed me so I assume I still depressed  well I just said I'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems so I just thought  that would  be a good idea so I did and that's what I found out  oh yeah definitely  I mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like I are most people probably can't afford therapy but just even talking to friends I would consider therapy somebody who listen so helps you get stuff off your chest  thanks  well I haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff  like out there like out of your head or whatever it's it's it helps to destress I think  pretty girls  I'm a good leader I'm really smart  being able to  survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help  yeah that stuff  just dumb mistakes I made when I was younger that  Looking Back Now with what I know now I probably would not have made  I would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible  he's always good for a  sort of pep talk but with a dose of reality doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective  talented  and I don't know good at stuff and get it a lot of stuff people seem to notice that I I guess nice could this position funny  okay  simulator  all right  are you like controlling a person in the back or today,7
314,don't I look gorgeous you straighten up a little bit here  okay now you're going to chat with her for a bit  okay  yes  quite well I feel good  Los Angeles California here  one of the few native-born Los angele ins  I homeschool my ten-year-old son and I'm a homemaker I have five children and married 22 years  about the full-time job  somewhat we can we went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church yeah so I would say yes I've traveled a bit  I will most recently we like 2 months ago we went to Israel for a pilgrimage we were gone about nine days and was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in Corazon which is near the Galilee and in a place called I mean the name of the area is causing but we stayed in place called The domus galilaeae which is  a house for that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims  I enjoy like really the most important I dress like meeting the people and and of course seeing that the history especially Israel amidst the totally ancient but most dangerous is the the people I think to get a better understanding of how different cultures  live  no not at all  just don't I have all my life I've always been  open and and willing to socialize and I remember my younger brother I was joking saying that I would talk to anybody and I will I'll talk to just about anybody just because I enjoyed learning about other people  most of the top five by the end of the day after I've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family I there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while and then watch TV have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know because we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late song  like to watch crime dramas  really mad probably not a lot  I get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but  in terms of like really getting like heated Langer I mean other than like little things that my children do you know especially my oldest child is 21 you know he can be confrontational cell  other than that nothing really gets me like really angry  haven't I have haven't felt that  contributing to society helping  helping to raise responsible people I guess  and of course the love and affection in the the sun and the excitement that goes with it and all the stages that go I mean like really right now I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers I only had I have one 11 year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have to have a challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff  the hardest thing is that it's 24/7  you never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's I remember when I first with my first child thinking you know when I brought him home from the hospital this is it I mean there's no going back you cannot change I mean I guess you could if you did something horrible but I mean the normal circumstances you can't change that and it's a permanent thing and  it is in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom  always  I'm sorry I didn't get what you said  some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church and my face but also my husband he's been a really  he's kind of his very like logical thinking and very grounded so if I get emotional or I get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he gets upset about something I'm able to balance him out so it's been it's been a great gift in my life  I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper occasionally I occasionally I get angry but I don't like have like rarely do I have outbursts I'm more more likely to you know to say what I feel not let it build up so you don't like my husband and I don't  rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because I like I said I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot self I'm thinking something I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up  usually I'm arguing with my older son because he you know he thinks he knows everything he's 21 years old so he has the know-it-all mentality and I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know I was like was on Hiller and more and he's very confident and very self  cell phone with the ra self-assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all  it is a can be  I think that many of them are spoiled and living environment of  of instant gratification which I think is going to be detrimental to the to the future of this country but  in a given that with all the technology we have is really not any way to go back so I I have hope that they will I mean I think this country was built on hard work and an ethics and hopefully our art the Next Generation and the generations after that can maintain that that standard of living I don't know if it's possible  as loving nurturing funny  we laugh a lot and  caring honest  things that I mean my best I have will actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that I grew up with and we for some years took care of their mother was Alzheimer's before my parents got sick so I would had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so I'm considered the fourth sister so I would say that those are my best friends and and  we love each other very much is a good relationship  no  no  yes  most mostly mine early depression it was more anxiety probably it's probably been five or six years I mean I've had it off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager I think is when I first had started with anxiety but  other than that I let you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control but now it's under control so I have a great huh  no I think it was what they call fleece free floating anxiety more of a organic reason for it in other words that there was a chemical imbalance  in my brain  I've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great good family gatherings a little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out my dad is really sick and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of  some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throes of that and so that's a big big change but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get their in their 80s  so as I get closer to death I want to have my family there with them  not easy usually all my life I think I've always I mean I've always had at least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom basically  other than that I mean no not sleep well I mean other than that I sleep well but sometimes if I wake up like really early in the morning then I can't go back to sleep I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep because I want my schedule is when if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors  sometimes it does  probably basically the same I think I might complain the bit like oh I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but I think overall I'm probably the same  my kids know I'll be there I'll tell my get though I'm really tired and they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful and letting my the. I will try to cook dinner or something like that so that you know  then they put you in a little bit more  not really not not no  not really. I think significant  actually yes I do I do feel like therapy is useful  well we had a situation with my daughter  she also suffers from anxiety and we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently our we're about to finish a group with her it was a 6 months  group for DVT it's called and it's like a the first time that is the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how do you know the actual physical and mental strategies to keep you or keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or we know  in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and I both have been going with our daughter and it's been really really informational and really helpful I think  oh my God I was she was in a bad way she was being all suffering a lot and we knew it and we acted on it that's all  like  really joyful and happy I would say probably  probably would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the ethic in Cana  so you know where the wedding of Cana took place that was really moving and beautiful and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day we flew to Israel on so it was right at the same time it was beautiful  find meaningful and other than that I would say you know like other joyful occasions have been you don't like Christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned 83 on Christmas Eve you know that kind of think so  that's an interesting question I would say  once I get like things done that I need to do like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or  answer one once I get them done I feel like I could sense of accomplishment  you know much like I mean I worked for many years in it as an administrative manager at UCLA and  you don't want to get a project done or you get your whatever month-end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that have to meet deadlines or so that feeling of like yeah I got it done you know so I think that would be a no for me the most  most recent way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished  dream job  I think I've already lived it I'm also a birth Doula and yeah and so I've attended a lot of Earth and now I really only do it for family and friends and it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth of bringing a new life into this world so I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know what I trained much after you know I did my managerial stuff and  with all it is and was awesome so I don't work at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that I work at is now closed but  but like I said it for family and friends  I attended a friend of mine's Birth by accident she up she happen to have the same old BS I did with all my children and I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were freaking out close friends and you know her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there she wanted me to say she didn't want me to leave I hadn't planned on it so that was the first birthday I attended outside of it you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that it was really interesting and interested in possibly setting nurse-midwifery  but then I discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more Hands-On one-on-one contact with the patient which is what I like  so I tried to do that at the hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago cuz my son is 15 and he was a year Old Mill 16 years ago so  yeah and I've been  well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman is in labor but and you know also like for me I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be there dual that I cannot guarantee 100% I'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available somebody else could fill in for me so but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me I've been able to be there for some reason still there  the the only one that I missed was one A friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby I was with her for her first but her labor went so fast you didn't call me in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of Labor she would even if it called me I would have been there in time so I went really fast but other than that you know  yeah I've been I've been able to attend all the verse of people that have asked me to do  all of life or in your job  probably might my own births I mean my the birth of my own children  like there's an extreme  sense of Joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can explain it's just it's awesome after you give birth so  and I've experienced both ways I've done both natural and I at my last job was a spy a C-section so I've had both both experiences  all right with my Fairchild had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when I was in labor it wasn't funny and she  she was not there when the doctor I mean it was my third child was  born very quickly after he broke the water and wolf my husband was there but she was not in there with the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great cuz I didn't have to go through any of the labor but I'm sure they weren't happy that you fill out a lot of paperwork after that  so  now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago  10 or 20 years ago is probably more not as some relaxed not as  like I feeling out my age that  I don't have the same concerns that I did then it's I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me I don't worry at all about what you know you know like why I noticed my daughters on Mom you can't wear that because people are going to say this I said I don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that owe mom you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever so that would probably be at the wisdom that you you achieve with AIDs that you do see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things  most proud of  probably my family like my husband and my my children I mean the fact that we've stayed married that we weren't intact family that my kids see every day how their friends suffer who who come from divorced families or single parents and they they actually Express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so I would say that's probably it  probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgemental through the years I've had a lot of experience with  people with problems lot of friends with problems people I know from church and it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and I don't think I'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else and that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough  okay  okay  goodbye  real quick,1
315,okay okay alright okay you  Inglewood California  yeah  no  that's okay  give me my girlfriend and my daughter  yes  are OKC okay cool  yes I do  well I'm football recruiter so I travel all around the world to to sign different football players for sports management company  I'm just the Independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it's great  I'm I remember traveling to  and take them to clubs and this and that and we're not that type of organization  dishonesty I don't like when people are dishonest that really really really bothers me and not true not on its not real that that upsets me a lot  I tend to just  try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind when usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head in my head  I'm okay with it at times but I can definitely be better  oh I already argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter in summer thing she's doing at school and she she wants to raise her one way and I think I want a razor a kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situation so I think different discipline is a big key in a kid's life and she she she was raised a little differently  I don't know just angry upset you know when you're an argument that's what you feel so you do and say things that that that bother you and you just go on with it  yeah a little bit  I don't know I just  that's the way I feel I don't know I can't really say this way I feel  a little a little  I don't know just  realness  honesty truth to spend straight out front  I'm pretty clothes pretty clothes for my family  Oh Holy Night the subjective  they're raised different societies going to become even Wilder what the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they're doing everything we we stay live and everything's inflated so much to where it's a skin to a point where it's getting out of hand I think kids these days to a certain extent are or much wilder than I was and and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and in all just education-wise is this I think it's just tough times for kids and in the way they act it's it's it's ridiculous to me  I definitely like to watch sports I like to gamble I I like to travel but I can skate I like kind of like a a guy that likes to see different sites and go different places like that I'm a big movie person so I like going to theater stuff like that  I'm actually living it I always wanted to be in in some kind of sports industry and that's what I'm doing now I just my goal was to get a little higher and a ladder and you know my own sports management company but I'm doing pretty well for myself so I am happy yeah  no  no  no  it's okay that's it's pretty easy  irritated  Tire  I don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile couple weeks ago  how would you say  no not really  I think he would describe me as a stand-up guy I try to be a good loyal friend and  and I don't think you would describe me like that  school went to school grew up together I've been knowing all my friends for 3 months on my life  there  a very close with my friends and I are very close together still at this age  I'm honest loyal very loyal  I am a hard worker I think I am  tooth hurts and I'm just not the average guy I'm pretty much I'm a different different breed I just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy  I don't know I just saw it but I was raised and high on my dad was kind of different and he didn't go with the In Crowd and I think I learned that from me and my Lawton and it's just it's it's kind of  same path I took  yes a lot of things I regret I regret  a lot of dishes in my life  yeah one  I actually let a a lady in my life goal years ago that I thought was my soulmate and we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then not in that break I I start dating somebody else and I told her I'm going to go my way and she go away I think that was a big a bad decision very bad decision  you've done anything to avoid you have totally I think I should have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of a  being so upset and moving forward  I just upset I tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so I need to think a little more when I'm upset  I don't know just  experience a Time been do you know making it making up for your mistakes and and then in  being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes  think a little harder by situation about situations and and things and the decisions that you make us think a lot longer and harder before you may come and I think the outcome will be in a little different today  my grandmother she's always been a positive influence she's a great black woman with old school  the ways of living so I think I have a bad at that to my life is a great woman  and baseball and yeah  I was a pretty good player I was a pretty good athlete growing up I was one of the top  and that started a future event and Athletics and that's what I wanted to do so I accomplished my girls who at the time was a great a great thing and still is a great thing it's a great accomplishment of my life  accomplishments being able to fry or if I'm  have a goal or something I'm supposed to do that week or that day and I compliment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and out the way I'm supposed to do it in this in a timely fashion always with mega ball  being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our Sports Academy program I think as I got an older the thought process and the way I look at life is totally changed and I think I got a lot of kids can look up to me that I deal with now and say you know that somebody that that is is a pot of positive of going to my life  oh  couple days ago my football team where in the playoffs make the playoffs so I always makes me happy  thank you  I get by  finished,2

318,all right  okay  oh actually before that one thing I almost forgot to do something that stinks  are you okay  yes  I'm all right  Los Angeles California  the lights big city it's always something going on  the traffic and that's it  business administration and business management  not that about something else I'm doing networking at the moment  to open up a big clothing line and just Supply the whole world with clothing  yeah  definitely  I'm all about myself it's all about me  not often but more times than not yeah  being lied to and I guess people think you're dumber than do anything with you are  try to get away from everything going to my own space  very well I'm great at controlling my temper  probably like 2 days ago it was probably just over some sports it wasn't a real argument  not a lot but I travel enough  just being able to get a change of pace see somebody knows he new faces new environment  let me see the last trip I had was Vegas you know how Vegas cuz it was pretty fun it's a lot of a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on  I'm pretty open-minded I'm kind pretty much everybody I'm a pretty even-keel guy  it's all right it could be better  no  no ma'am  nope  no  lately it's been pretty tough I guess cuz I've been staying up so late but that's my fault  I don't know I guess I'm a night owl all of a sudden I'm turning into an hour  sluggish and tired all day if I don't sleep well all day I'm just laying around  no not too much  give  stay focused and listen to the adults  yeah  self-explanatory I could have just listen to parents are other adults I tried to steer you in the right way and you know you're being a stubborn kid at that at those ages so it's like why do what are you talkin about I miss my life I can do what I want I don't have to listen to you but now I see that with every telling me was correct  how would your best friend describe  hilarious  are you to your family pretty close  both my parents mother and father  recently did I do a New Year's Eve party I had thought I had the time of my life it was so fun  I'd love to hear all about  this New Year's Eve I went to a party at friend's house in Baldwin Hills area he had it at a pretty nice house it's a three-story house and it was like 350 people in there it was pretty fun but it was also not that fun because it was telling people and you couldn't really move so that was the only downfall of the size that I brought my new year in great with tons of friends and that's how supposed to be done  what are some things that usually put in  I'm generally in a good mood every day I mean waking up with me in a good mood I guess you can say that but I don't know how good a good meal  one of my most memorable experiences are probably when I was younger I was in Boy Scouts and we should go camping all the time and one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite one of those places and we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge and of course made from the city I'm like a mountain biking I can ride a mountain bike but once we got in the real mountains on got on real mountain bikes I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers it was pretty it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour and dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense and I was I'll never forget that  I don't know that's a tough one.

why do I miss la  about 20 years ago  once every 3-4 years  I mean the first 6 months it was a little difficult but then I got used to it and then until I feel very comfortable now  yes  the food of actually I enjoyed flying then you know meeting different people different scenes  you know then it right try to achieve my goals  I'm sorry  I used to run a business I used to travel to meet people to get orders and that traveling involved and going to Northeast Vienna Ohio and Pennsylvania places like that meet top people to get my to get orders for my business and you know why I enjoyed listening to that problem so used to take them out for dinner and you know I really enjoyed genuinely enjoyed talking to talking to them and many of them we're opening up to tell me about their problems and you know but my main goal main main objective was to get the orders for the business  you don't cook watch movies make friends throw a party  I'm talking to you  I'm an engineer I did mechanical engineering I'm also in NBA  actually I Bradshaw to finance I trade stocks now  A friend of mine was you know making a lot of money in stocks and you know I was  first I used to you know we interact with him will also be with him when he was trading stocks and I realized he was making a lot of money than I did a form of course in that attended a lot of seminars then you know  lost a lot of money and before I started making money  so it's the same thing that I said you don't watch movies go visit people  play basketball  then do shopping cooking  I'm very good at that you know  even when I'm irritated and I'm very good at controlling my temper  the last time I argue with  was with my brother it was about my dad peanut but you was getting old I mean he's getting old and he lives in India and I was planning on bringing it here my dad's I mean my brother said it's going to be very expensive to  you know it's going to be very expensive with respect to health bills and I was arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here because they are quite old I have a mom to you know they're both old  I'm very close to my parents not so closed with my brother and their family  it's deep I mean like  I tend to be judgmental and I think sometimes that the my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way and you know  and you know my my brother doesn't seem to think along the same lines and you know but we have disagreements and you know that's the reason  it is  no not at this time  what do I think of wife  can you can you repeat that one more time  can I still couldn't follow you  okay  no  no  oh yes  Wanted 2 years ago  I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that are that I would normally interested in  and you know I was sort of withdrawn and the it was I was not able to focus on my things so I thought maybe I should go see a doctor and I ended up doing that  no  how many died last appetite I was not sleeping well and  I had difficulty concentrating you know and focusing and I would not getting my assignments done on time these were some of the problems  I've been feeling good  but  no I don't  I started doing yoga and you know I've been doing that for about a year and that's and meditation and that's helped a lot  so it's just that you know when I was diagnosed with depression I thought I should be taking any medication for it and I was looking at it other ways to get over the problem and then I realized some of my friends we're doing meditation and  oh you know I ain't got into in Spider-Man  it's a little difficult but after I've been able to sleep with in half an hour there are days when it takes almost 1/2 hours to go to sleep  are they what can you repeat that  oh no  I

among the top 2% in my MBA class and  and when I used to run my business I designed a product that was working really well  and I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business  my  I'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly very easy to get along with  very focused very intelligent  and a good cook  Albert Einstein  of  summer summer summer full stories  you know he obviously didn't it involves lot of deep thinking and are the the first few times I write about him about his theories I had difficulty in really understanding that and that it over  I mean when when when there are things that I really try to understand and I am not able to  and you know they're out there all the type of people I admire  listen to other people  are its diverse and I like the the entertainment industry  and  I like a  the other fact that there are more women than men here  there are certain areas where Wendy's where only Spanish is spoken you know I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English  so that everybody can participate  in LA  me like I  some of the things the political leaders do really makes me mad sometimes I think they're wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing and you know what these guys don't get things done and you know I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry  yeah I mean the first four years of Obama administration now I think it was wasted because if the  if Congress had acted together and got things done then you know  maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us and you know the fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people steal you know arguing  you know follow-up find fault with each other and not get things done. They don't seem to realize that you don't you know that clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done  I mean like you know well  one thing that comes to my mind is well you know I made a lot of money while we know once in Los Angeles and you know I thought it happened during Christmas some 10 years ago  and that's that made me very happy  good music good food  I mean the party with friends that I like  hand  and  you know I also like cooking and I enjoy cooking with groups in groups do the things that really put me in a good mood  I'm sorry clean  I listen to people  and I empathize try to solve their problems  and I'm hoping they think I'm it up my advisers and recommendations are worth their time  thank you so much to be nice by,5

325,start a chat with you for a bit and then  okay  yes  I'm fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human  I was born I was born that way I was raised out in the suburbs I've lived all over Los Angeles live in the valley Long Beach and now I'm in Culver City  there's great food here the weather is great most of the time is a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold I don't have to shovel snow there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people I think that's really great  that is a much longer left I would like to get out of here the the traffic heading that's number one I think everybody hits in traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody so devoted to their jobs and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too  I just graduated actually I study marine biology  I was I went to school and I recently studied graphic design and I found that kind of unfair feeling so I took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and I realize that I really love marine biology so that's how I got into it  everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated I think I would like to I think maybe managing a managing a research  you know I'm not I'm not really sure I think I would like to  Something in tropical Marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve something like that hard question to answer  I do  I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world  I travel for 8 months in Central America and I visited a lot of different countries I  I went scuba diving  I think I think intolerance Injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up  Brett's my boyfriend does that count  I'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I am going to blow my top of the very few people have seen me angry to the point where I'm kind of yelling and screaming and I don't know I just don't get there I think that I'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so I keep it under control  if it was yesterday Ashley I argued with my boyfriend about getting getting a job I was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and I really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for 6 months cuz I miss you and he was just being supportive so we kind of argued about that it was ridiculous so we I ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight  meditate exercise go out in nature just unplug at myself away from computer away from Technology Way from people  I would say not really I'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example I'm a pretty adventurous person and I like learning and my parents are couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activity so you know I love them and everything but there's not too much common ground  guess I think about our social introvert but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining where is my my boyfriend for example he drives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people from me it's always a little bit the opposite I have to recharge  not sure I have a best friend but I guess I'll see my boyfriend he's he's kind of my default best friend he would probably say passionate intelligence he always tells me that I'm really hard on myself which is true dedicated loyal  I think I'm just proud of who I am going to I don't know if that's the answer that most people have but I think that I'm I'm really proud of who I am I try really hard I've done a lot of things in my life I'm a really good person I think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and I consider myself a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so I'm I'm proud of that  no I have not  no  yes  I was probably about 15 at the time so I think he was that 17 years ago  yes  I was cutting and my one of my best friends called called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment that wasn't the first time I had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but before it was more they thought I'd ADHD so it was I think my parents really took me and rather than me seeking help  I haven't for about 3 years I stopped because it felt like I was check in with a parole officer I just wasn't enjoying the relationship I had but I still have a psychiatrist that I go to for Med checks  I do think it's useful if you have the right therapist I think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist you can be incredibly harmful I have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back  lately I've been a little bit down since a little bit more down than usual because I graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things 24/7 has come to an end and without the routines been a little bit weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real-world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologist in California  almost impossible ever since I was a little kid I had to Chaya trouble falling asleep and about four years ago it became really really bad where I just couldn't sleep through the night I was getting about 4 hours of sleep sometimes I would wake up every hour and I wake up in the morning just to complete wreck so for about 4 years I've been taking trazodone so I can sleep  have you ever seen Fight Club your virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that I  I'm just a complete Panic anxious reggae I lose my ability to deal with  at least my ability to deal with things I'm much more likely to lose my temper I can't regulate my moods I'm just really volatile  probably a few months ago I think that I may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgot to take my medicine with me or something like that and then I can't sleep in so that's what happens  really happy I mean it's easy for me to be easier for me to keep track of when I feel really really bad really happy I guess I felt happy on New Year's really happy on New Year's Eve which was  10 days ago I was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to Palm Springs and Joshua tree and it was really nice to see them I don't get to see them very often because I've been in school and I've been so busy as it was really nice reintroduction to real life  I think that I am I'm kind and considerate I'm tolerant I'm pretty open-minded I'm aware of my faults I just tried to be nice to everybody and  I'm very curious about about the world and things that I don't know about I really like to learn  off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue hole in Belize that was really amazing it was me and my friends we just jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this Limestone sinkhole and its really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in  something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and as you go down then you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge there larger than a human at cuz it's this cave system and its really murky and there sharks swimming around 2 or so  that's pretty good  I'm trying to remember that the moment I haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school is reading hiking just being together with my friends doing relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking thing with my cat  not that I can really think of I'm sure I've made mistakes in my life but you know I'm still here so can't be that bad  I know hang in there I hold onto your clothes cuz the 90s are coming back in fashion  cloudy weather beautiful sunsets being in being out in nature kind of being away from the hubbub of the city  getting a good grade  I think my boyfriend has he's just especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and I know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy I should say so to see someone overcome that really inspired me  okay,10

328,okay now I'm going to start at the root  okay  hey  are you okay  yes  fine how are you  I watch California but now I live in West LA  I love the sunshine of the palm trees I love that you're 30 minutes away from everything straight City  the traffic is terrible  best Early Child Development  yeah actually I teach children how to be safe in a traffic situations  jumper dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what I want to do I want to die doing that job making movies  well when I was in high school I did a lot of drama theater Productions and I just love everything about film so once I had the opportunity to actually make a film because I wasn't getting any work as an actor I just got hooked I just love making feel  last time I made a film just this last October made it short film  it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally  thanks  really mad  it really mad I you know I guess what makes me really mad as when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and she doesn't pay attention and I have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad  yes sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school  no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find a negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know * 152 deal with that but other than that it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy  the hardest thing about being a parent I would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't want to take it they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt and it's sad and then they want to come in your life. I tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way  yeah I guess for a while when you think about it when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they want to learn cuz once they get it they got it so however they get it as a pair of your happy they got it  all the love the children bestow upon you is great they yeah they let you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me she always tells me I'm doing a great job when does she know about a great job she's only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so I like that  I got there you know like Albert Einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out their kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they missed going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to YouTube are you know wherever Facebook and in getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up its pushed and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong  me cook just breathe in breathe out or I'll just walk away from the situation  argued  I argue with my fiance couple months ago about  gosh I forgot I forgot I don't remember  it was petty yeah they didn't last long cuz she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff would like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it  my fiance  elk me we met when I was working at at a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and we talked we hit it off we didn't see each other for the entire year and then we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since  my family were pretty close my brother lives in Colorado and my sister lives in Oklahoma I have a dad that lives in a neighboring City where I am as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away but my immediate family like you know my fiance and my daughter like we're close and it's great  I don't travel enough but I have traveled a couple of times within the last 5 years I just came back from New Zealand so that was a great experience  I enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling I like seeing new things I like just immersing myself in different cultures and situation and I like just being away from it all that's good too  well I went to New Zealand not too long ago and I stayed there for a week I learned about Celsius cuz you know here we have Fahrenheit and that was fun I learn how to play cricket I learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak and I learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good I like lamb but they have a lot of land in their Sufi food I can eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is so good and ice cream was good too and other people who are really really nice they say it was a very special time for me to go there was great and they accepted me I love that and yeah can't wait to go back  yes it was  some of my best qualities energetic a very personable of intelligent I am easy to get along with I work pretty hard and I'm very slow to getting upset about things  no  no  it's fairly easy  I guess I get pretty moody you know I could be a little little Snappy at people when I don't sleep well when I have lack of sleep but once I get some sleep in me I'm okay  no no no changes no  you know he would say that I'm pretty funny lacks about a lot of things I enjoy life as much as I possibly can good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help  things that usually  just waking up in the morning it's always a great thing I love ice cream that's always good I love laughing if somebody's laughing especially my fiance cuz he has a great then that puts me in a good mood  thank you  and that's what I want to do I definitely want to get into acting and really work it and get some really good rolls so he's going to positive influence he stayed out of trouble he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging  oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend  yeah  yes it is  wow there's so many  had a nice bag of M&Ms and we have went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are they don't know how that you know they say they don't like somebody but you know anyway but we got these M&Ms and Wilder it was dark we start throwing M&Ms and hit them in the head with M&Ms and then we came to school like 3 days later and we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get  so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like 2 days  oh man you name it all of scuba diving I've only done it twice but I love it when I get back into it like traveling I love exercising I actually like working out now I used to think it was a chore but now I'm really really getting into it that I love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and I'm a happy camper so about it in the family  Eric Rhett  you know what I think I probably regret not going up to Will Smith when I had the chance  yeah Will Smith was coming up the street and I saw him and I got so nervous I jumped in the bushes and I didn't meet him my boss of the time thought it was really funny but I just I wasn't ready to meet him yet so but I think I regret meeting him  advice would you give yourself time  advice I would give myself 10 or 20 years ago I would probably say that when my gut told me to do something I should have just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and Analyse it you know days weeks months later if I feel it in my gut I should go for it so go with my gut more  really happy  really happy I had a film festival that I was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things are going right but then once the people came and packed the house I was really happy that we had a packed house at this stuff in front of school so this is about a month ago  let's see I think right now at this point I'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and I didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and I'm proud of that I was able to get it done I think I could walk away happy knowing that I gave it a really good shot and I think this movie is probably going to take me in the rest of my film crew buddies to higher Heights  oh really  all right well what was your name again  Ellie goodbye  that was awesome  no,4
329,equipment  virtual human chat with you for a bit and when she's done  okay  are you okay  yes  pretty well  from New York  to go to college or go to San Diego to go to college and then later to LA  aerospace engineering  it was I was really good at math and science and I had an interest in airplanes  no  I'm a life coach  how to be a life coach and help people  have I really really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that I made a contribution to their life  I like the weather is great cuz I really like to do outdoor things and I like doing things by the ocean  traffic and how crowded it is  yeah  I like I live with my girlfriend and I liked it  we met on eHarmony  I really close  hi my meditation teacher  yeah I used to be very shy and self-conscious and have a lot of anxiety and worry a lot about the future and 2 classes meditation and yoga classes and really helped me to be more confident more relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more  meditate and do yoga  seriously mad  I don't know about bad I don't get mad that often but frustrated I would say like being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason  I usually if it's usually talk to somebody about it if I can or if I can't then I usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go  a pretty good that controlling my temper  with my girlfriends and it was about she was driving on the freeway and I suggested that she get over cuz there were some Road workers on the side and she like refused to do that stayed in the the right lane so we argued a little bit about that  I felt like she wasn't listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what I suggested to be defiant  no  rollerblade kayak sing I sing in the choir  I trip I took to India and Nepal for 6 weeks  yeah as much as I can  I really love to explore and I'd love to explore ever since I was a little kid and so I love you and seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures and I love backpacking in the wilderness and see no exploring nature  well I went on a trip to India and Nepal it's my first time ever there the first week and a half of his with a big group of people and did a meditation and Yoga Retreat and went white water rafting on the ganga River and then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there and I was just really beautiful in the Annapurna area and then I went to back into India and explored the area up near to bed and then I went to Rajasthan into a tiger Park in my diaper desk and it's like really close to tigers  I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this this trip and I'd always wanted to go to India so I decided to do it  yeah I was there was really fun  caring and enthusiastic for life  now  no  no  I'm pretty easy I don't sleep as well as I did when I was younger but for the most part I sleep well once in a while I'll wake up you know at like 4 in the morning or 5 in the morning when I want to sleep till 7 and not be able to get back to sleep but in general is pretty good  I feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon  no  10 or 20 years ago  I guess to wish I would have been vested money or bought like a house or something when I was younger  I would probably get it right so I get myself  I am sympathetic with other people positive and can I have a positive outlook on life very determined when I decide to do something I'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging very creative and figure it out creative ways to do things I guess probably the strongest thing is that I'm pretty balanced very organized but I'm also pretty creative so pretty balanced that way  I'm pretty close but closer than I was when I was younger although I said probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual Community with me then I'm able to get to my family  being outdoors and nature and exercising and also singing  the fact that I've gone with followed my heart and then what I wanted to do versus going with what I think I should do  I guess yesterday I was. I spent the day by the beach and just bicycle then went skating and visited some old friends there  I felt very relaxed and invigorated and also felt like I missed living by the beach cuz I used to live really close to the beach  so I guess I let little bit sad that I didn't live there anymore but really happy to be there  goodbye,1
330,I want I want to build a program with one of those my friend has one he said yeah make a game or something  yeah  she's pretty who do we know who she is models on  yes I'm okay with this  very good  la  it's sunny and  it's near the ocean  the traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places  and  there's a lack of  Open Spaces if you're not near the beach  I know  I haven't planned on  haven't finalized any travel plans  listen to music  yeah  well I tend to excel of things at  how to do a thumb  spending time alone versus  things that have to do with  spending time outside with lots of people  I'm reasonable  Maybe  maybe yesterday I was trying to figure out how to pack something into the car  I'm pretty good at it  I breathe in and out like that  I like jogging walking bicycling  reading  listen  listening to music  math engineering computers  a little bit yeah  student going back to school for a biological sciences  I started doing some reading on  text books  jammed  medical doctor  I guess it depends on  what type of medicine you practice  the mentor  tell me about  yeah I have a mentor as a lot of positive  Datsun  suggestions  through professional  so I met someone through a class then they work with them professionally so it's I guess you could say through an academic or professional Channel  see  my most memorable  I can't think of one at the moment  no  no  I don't think so no  takes me a little while to fall asleep but once I'm asleep it's that's reasonably okay  I think I'm a little forgetful and nervous  no  sometimes  what do you want to know  well I think sometimes I do think about  challenges ahead of me  and I can be a little daunting and I feel down  it is very hard  go for a walk read a book listen to some music  I don't I mean I'm sure they are  I'm not specifically sure what triggers anything I may be  feeling  overwhelmed  not feeling particularly tied to  some task  I don't go to a therapist  recently smart and quit inquisitive and curious  I guess your classes  somewhat  patience and curiosity  I went on a walk at night  a dago  no  can you repeat that  can you rephrase that  I think they're lucky very lucky  but everything in front of them yeah  most proud of  maybe I could done with the cheese mints  I guess just the time to spend  studying math and science  not sure,12
331,okay  all right  how about what she's at okay. Thank you  yes  okay  Connecticut  to be an actor  well I moved to San Francisco in 94 and then I moved to Atlanta in 96 and then I moved out here to be an actor and I became a realtor instead  I'm to be on a TV show actor  it's pretty hard to get discovered and  you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented  that really no I don't travel that much I used to move every couple of years to a different city and then I've been here for a while so I don't travel  the weather there's always something to do and  that's pretty much it  the people here tend to be a little more rude and it's just always a fast pace  but when I moved here I was 25 so it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city you can have a lot of fun and then I got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now I'm old and I'm not making any money so times are tough  no no I'm not much of a more of an extrovert  when I don't get what I want and rude people and  just inconsiderate people  I'm pretty good at controlling my temper when I'm not like if I if I drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but when I don't drink I'm pretty good at controlling my temper  the last time I argued with somebody was  somebody that owes me money  I live in West Hollywood  no no no I live alone I have a dog  it's good I mean I don't like my neighbors I hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in or not that noisy and the ones below I just can't stand because they argue with  why because they cuz my hardwood floors they say that I've been there for 10 years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors  yeah  what was the question  my mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track she lived with me for the last 10 years until she recently moved to Rhode Island to live with my brother  very close to my mother not so close with my brother were close but we're not like close close so I mean we love each other we just don't really understand each other all the time  outgoing life of the party  ambitious  and sometimes Cut Throat  hum  do you always able to get through the things I need to get through to get to where I want to be  I'm generous I'm loyal I'm friendly I'm accommodating and  that's about it  no  yes  about 4 years ago  well I had was beating up and I had identity theft and you know I was just afraid to go out so I needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving that just depressed all the time I I said I have to get out and start talking to people and so I did  thank you  I'm okay I'm panicking about the job situation you know cuz my bills are pretty high and I don't really have a steady income right now  so that's what's worrying me the most is my financial situation  yeah I mean  well basically it's like I just recently quit drinking altogether so I don't drink anymore so I'm noticing yeah I mean it's good cuz the number one I don't have the money and number two I don't like the way I act when I drink I'm so so that's a positive thing but will the when I was drinking and help me just forget and numb myself now I have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good cuz I can talk my way through them so I guess I'm evolving  oh yeah long time ago you know I've taken many medications here and there and they really some of them would numb me some of them would make me feel hyper so I've recently decided in the last 6 months 3 to 6 months just to not take anything so I don't take anything I barely even take an aspirin  to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  not really  always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if I get in a car accident what happens if I can't pay my mortgage what happens if I eat just so many things I worry about and that's what was making me depressed  I do at some point I've had some good therapist and I've had some bad therapist I tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kind of give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen and then they just say okay your time is up so and just prescribed me medication so I think I'd be better with a psychiatrist psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist  well I'm not going to therapy now but  the therapy that I had before I was more like people trying to just come in and check in and give me medication I have had other therapy where I was back in the forest like okay well this is what I think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better  I just I wasn't getting the right therapist recently so and I knew that the root of my problem was the drinking cuz it's a depressant so  stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just a work through things myself you know  I can't really think of anything right now  it's been a long time I can't really think about a time when I felt really happy  okay when I was a kid I had a little dog and this big dog came in and attacked and killed it so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them so I was like yeah yeah yeah cuz I never listen to my parents like a spoiled brat to go to the car what's up  he said go to the car and get this out of the car so I finally went when I open the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable experience  yeah cuz I'm an animal lover so  just the way that I've treated people before when I was hurting I was really mean or rude to people but I felt like you know I was hurting I had to hurt everybody around me so ever since I stopped drinking I don't do that anymore so I'm  so I think the problem is is the drinking and so now that I've let that go cuz I was doing it for the wrong reasons you know I was doing it to them not feel I wasn't doing it to be sociable  getting a career that is really stable like you know like a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising I should have gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it and sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things  what I have a job when I when I'm able to work when I'm helping other people  what other people around me are happy and laughing when I can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood  okay thank you  you're welcome thank you  okay is this modeled after a real person or is it just like they just,8
332,import and I wonder if people really like understand it you know what I mean like a people do judge yeah bizarre  I did like The Ricki Lake Show with my friend and I saw myself I TV oh my God yeah but I was speeding I was I was eating candy and I was gone  it's like that  and and then I was looking at Ricki Lake like there must be some around my eyes cuz I was like she was like right there I don't know why it's so I had to actually like act you know I'm in the audience but I have to like pretend like I was interested in what you have to say but it looks so I kept looking at her like that like there's something wrong in my eyes no I just thought I was in a doctor's office and they had it on and it's like God it was funny cuz there's these guys like winking at me on the way I like that celebrity 8 dividing sitting there it's like I hated every minute of it but we got sewing machines free sewing machines $200 sewing machines that day it was yeah so it was worth it was worth it but I was so embarrassed yeah only if you get stuff it's worth it otherwise are so stupid shows are so I can't believe that's what I want to television  so embarrassing  oh okay  right on okay this is so weird oh gosh I hope she's nice to me I hope so okay hello  are you okay  yes  fine just tired  California  from Hollywood  not too much  talk to me things I like about it  the people  it's not clean  too much crime too many drugs  eye makeup and hair  a little bit  not too much I just arrived  very difficult  I'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career but  I just want probably get married and have a little security that's all just be a wife again  a little bit close but everybody's pretty much passed away  I play FarmVille on Facebook  I'm good I don't really have a temper  with my ex-husband about money  people lying cheating conniving drug addicts you know just ugly people people that are  hideous and inside you know  Jesus Christ that's about it  my mother when she was alive when she still a positive influence but  nobody really but  Jesus  memorable experiences  I don't know I can't really think of one right now  gosh  experiences  all I guess like maybe modeling that was pretty cool yeah  yeah  I was just kind of  thrill like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff you know I didn't understand how it could have been me but then my photographer told me he was like well someone has to do to might as well be you so oh well and it's true so that was cool  just kind of fell into it by accident  I've always yeah yeah I wish I did it I took it further but I couldn't  really happy  I don't remember  I really don't  I really have a best friend but I'm sure  there anybody would describe me as outgoing  no  yes  how was the 1984  yeah  I can deal with it  so I had to see a psychiatrist  horrified couldn't sleep  panicked  major anxiety  oh yeah  yes I do  it could be if you see the right doctor  it gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody and  hopefully they can give you answers must have him don't they try to find the answers and side of you get it out of you but it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kind of biased neutral  really depressed  extremely depressed  poverty  yeah  yeah I'm a lot more tired I sleep longer and  I am  I just don't have the drive motivation that I did before  just try to be strong just have to get through it and now  yes  there are  not really  I'm an open book  well I would say perfection is but that's not really good quality cuz it can get dangerous  I'm just artistic I'm good at a lot of things  I'm really good at a lot of things but  well I'm good I'm a good hairdresser makeup artist I crochet and knit really well make jewelry  not good with computers or phones though Electronics  yeah  okay perfect house or well when I'm not depressed like this I was a perfect wife the perfect wife  hell yeah  but not anymore cuz I'm divorced now but it wasn't me it was him  he was on drugs so he chose the drugs were too much problems  yeah it does  it's really hard because it's like the drugs are his mistress  how do I what  who  yes  now  well I don't really consider myself an introvert  yeah  I have a lot of regrets but there really wasn't anything I could do about it so there's really no point in regretting it  cuz you do what you do and you make a decision and then  it's already done so why I regret it why bother you no  make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol  that's one for sure that was the only question I didn't answer ask I I didn't know  first lot of things  a lot of stuff  I don't know  just the things that I can do  that my talents that's it  well if I can have my Starbucks  and my orange Gina I drink orange juice everyday and I smoke cigarettes and fortunately but it's always good to have those because you know I'm addicted to them and then it's like it's something really  good and healthy at night time and it will basically if I have something to do if I have a goal of somewhere to go something to do like today then  let's meet a good man yeah otherwise I'd be afraid that I'd stay home and just lay in bed or perform all day I could form for 8 hours on FarmVille  you're welcome nice to meet you  so I pressed the button  you're good  she's good except for you know it's like the one I can she hear me by the way the one I always come is weird and distracting other than now the one  yeah she kind of made a mistake on one part,18
333,"okay alright  yes  very well  New York  this turn the volume up a little bit  4change that's good  I want it  wanted to see what Los Angeles was about  probably took a year to  not being away from my family being away from what I was used to in New York the neighborhood's the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here  all the weather  can't beat the weather generally always nice it's not too hot it's not too cold it's creative I do like in the movies  I like the beach  the traffic is a lot of traffic  some of it sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here then more distant and unfriendly than other places  I was a history major  no  I do I demonstrations in  a high end supermarkets  dog to be a screenwriter  that's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles  it's hard cuz I don't always maintain focus and motivation a lot of other things distract me  I was I've always been interested in films ever since I was a child and I just always do know was rioting and had an active imagination  I've been the last probably almost 10 years I've traveled more than I had in the past while I've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around so yeah  seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am seeing how they live  and taking in the sights  I went to Kenya that was probably one of the best trips ever went on on the Safari and  just going out in a Jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible  oh yeah that's one of the great experiences of my life and I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called  Sharm El Sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that Egypt would but it was just amazing how I didn't go scuba diving I went snorkeling  what do I do to relax I do I like to listen to music I like to help and watching movies help me relax cuz it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind I do meditate everyday  I like to take walks and nature that's always calling especially down by the the ocean  depends sometimes I get angry and lose my temper a lot of times  I'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something I've recently learned how to do  this is very helpful  and also since I meditate it doesn't I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past  some things that make me really mad  I guess I think of Injustice  and the world are done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along  and to make the world better  out last night I went to a movie screening  how about independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. So much that we had a fun argument about a about the movie  so that was like now that this happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind  is there anything I regret the other there are have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had  taking them and pursue them  a certain jobs you know when I first got the Los Angeles I had an opportunity to  become a grip and I probably should have pursued that  how do I decide to do that I don't really understand the questions  take advantage of every opportunity that came my way that says always I think saying yes  any opportunity is is very important in the matter  how you feel you know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do  now  now  no but I've been depressed in my life  I'll for the most part of I've been feeling good sometimes I feel a little blue I think sometimes I fight if I allow a  regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but I can you know you really get out of it pretty quickly  I'll sometimes Financial concerns sometimes  on an opportunity how do I explain it  the financials one way out that I had made another decision I might have more money or my life would be different  not really I mean I feel  pretty much the same  got me to sea kelp for  let's come back to that  well on his health when I did do that  stop pretty easy I don't have a problem sleeping  doodly I'm grumpy  so if I don't sleep well you know I feel tired and irritable  how would my best friend describe me  good question of why I'm definitely friendly and outgoing little bit secretive  probably that I should be there like to see me more accomplished and detaining my goals and it may be a little happier  I think  it's tough at the pants sometimes I'm very introverted cuz I do like to write so that takes means that I have to spend time alone and then when I come out of that I'm extroverted so I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation in my mood  my best qualities I think I'm caring I think I'm intelligent  I think I'm funny I'm out going I have a likeable personality and people have said that I'm engaging but not oppressive or overly engaging there's a set of a cool detachment  in Creative intuitive  yes  last time I felt really happy  I'll I woke up this morning I was pretty happy  at breakfast I was happy  Sun was shining  I think like I said going to Kenya  what's up memorable experience scuba snorkeling was a really great experience I just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean and out and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back  almost beyond beyond like  2 minute away this warrant touch with like everything in the universe  that would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but  what am I most proud of in my life  I think I've  helped  people  and sometimes when they were in crisis  in our Britain some screenplays  Pat some good relationships  good relationships just being connected with someone else you know  spending time with them and connecting  unemotional  physical and  metal levels  could be a song that I hear on the radio it could be a lot of times looking forward to something you know if I'm going to go to a movie go bowling hang out with people  you're not looking at work and then going to work and feeling productive and put me and puts me in a good mood  you're welcome bye bye  like that like what do you remember what  okay will you depressed and I was like  explain that and then it was like I did something and then it was like well bridge to that, got it got it",5
334,Usher  if I have to  I can see I mean I don't know exactly her face but I can see that's a woman  okay  okay  yes  I got a little tired  Seattle Washington  oh and I was 18 my mom and dad decide we want to move to California and so we move down to Pasadena to Monrovia first and I've been here ever since  yeah  I did about two years ago I went up for work and look around the area  pretty easy actually I do adapt  a warm weather not having rain tonight month of the year  people may lie  the the area how big it is a traffic  my first got here is a smog as better now  know when I was younger I was but I got out at work I did  sure why I became when I have my mom died and I need work I went for a job that was called petitioning and you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions and you do that after awhile you don't get shy about talking to anybody also when I was in school I took public speaking and I learned that I really liked it more than I thought I would  so I so I did the census job I actually got four front of groups of people and talk to them and show them how to take the test and I enjoyed it  right now I'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance  and I'm going to start work out trying to get money from people to help kids and the and the world  all the one the job helping kids was also a paid job I need a paid job the one for insurance cuz I was getting older and I need work that was steady and that's something I can do it on 85 or 90 or whatever  to be an artist  I always been good with art I like drawing painting excetra but I didn't know if I could ever make a living out so I never really got into it and every time I tried it seems I never got anywhere so maybe when I get like 80 or 90 mail going to the Ceramics or something to do that as a profession  no unfortunately.  That's okay  I'm not my mom and dad or die are dead I have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or I don't talk to him anymore or like that  I've have an attitude if I have me and friends I have and I'm okay  I read  watch Parts when they're available  I say I used to play golf I may do that again someday but not right now because of the cost and the time  people that rude  are usually ignored this morning actually I told a guy to stop what he's doing and we got kind of an argument about and then the argument is over and it was done  very good because I had a very bad temper I was a kid and I told myself I had to control it  August morning about the guy making lots and lots of noise on purpose and in a place that was just not the place to do it I mean it was a public place but  and I was in just a little argument and I'm done with the Army once I say what I say  yeah  not right now I can think of  oh I read  if I can travel I travel I don't travel long distances but even going out to Riverside is having adventure for me  seeing things on the way and back talk in the people maybe  well known for years ago I want rolled back he's to Massachusetts to do work back there on the way back I took a Greyhound bus all the way back from Washington DC see all the way back to California and the washing on 1st and I'm down from there and work in Massachusetts for a bottle at 6 months to 8 Mile and joy the area quite a bit but don't want to be there when the snow came  and  enjoy coming back on the bus had people next to me almost all the way different people and a lot of fun  yeah  yeah I was in the Air Force and when I was 18 1965 during the Vietnam war  no I was in Great Falls Montana  and I really don't know yours later I probably learned more from the fact that I got out early and maybe I should have stayed in and stuck with it as younger and so now that and other things aside never quit anything  I came down here play pool for number years find a graduate from high school which I dropped out of when I moved went on the college got my bachelor's degree and an AA degree in Pasadena and Cal State LA and start working various jobs and that's about it took care of my mom  a business was my major I also studied things like anthropology and philosophy and history excetera  no  no never do  lately not so good between the fact I sleep in my car and it's very cold and that sometimes I do get and with all the things going on in my life right now as I think of things can solve and plus I get up at 4:30 in the morning  that's okay  I tired  and I got a little grumpy sometimes but not very much  tired with all the things I've had to do and the weather and the sleep  no  a little bit sometimes about how maybe I should start doing all this years ago  I just go on I tell myself to basically stop it and go on doing what things to improve myself  not very anymore took me years to study dad to do that  I don't know if you called Xander not bud  a couple months ago and I passed all my tests and Medicare Advantage  passed every one of them for every come in and send them to me  I expect everything I do now on persistent  I don't let things get out of hand before I do something about it  I used to be what's the word I put off things I don't do that anymore  hand  I treat people nicely always until given a reason not to  and I don't talk about my bad stuff to anybody usually  not very because the same thing I've trained myself over the years that not talk about myself I talk to other people talk about them  how I said my mother  Gabby  Bertrand Russell  I'm not sure who else other people I've had that I don't remember their names or they were teachers excetera  early in life I like I said I stopping everything not completing things that I regret very much  oh yeah I could have done better  probably device I gave myself to get off my butt and go learn get an education and get all of my life and do something  dog survive  tell me about  well I'm 65  I've been sleeping in my car for a number of years I went from sleeping on pavement or I got a car lot done that improve my credit rating I've got a number of jobs I've been very happy with I have had a lot of friends both all people that are homeless and on Alma's  Handa  have a pretty good health  how are the other people in my family have died young  so I guess that's about it  good jokes  people having a happy time  going to having a drink with somebody on occasional basis  how about eight months ago was last time when I had a beer with someone  I say  probably  can I wasn't one foot of a live wild deer  I was in a green Lake and Washington  and I was out behind your house and that's wild buck deer was walking in the field and I started motion into it and came of them out one foot of me and the only reason I left my dad drove down the driveway and it made a noise and the deer ran off how is with embedding difference distance of them and I wasn't too sure if I should have had them or not but I was about to  I do  why  she's pretty cool for a knot  okay,5
335,start up a virtual human who will chat with you for a bit and then when she's done she'll let you know and I will put the  okay sounds good  yes  I'm okay  I'm from here originally Los Angeles  I like the weather  and my family's here which is why I'm here I've moved away for awhile I like that there's a lot of even though everyone says there's no culture in La there is a lot of culture there's theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people I like the diversity  well I don't like that I had to move back into my will so starting a new career starting over in my career it said that's not really something I move back cuz my dad was sick  so  thank you thank you  I'm here but it also means I live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous  acting theater  yeah yeah I am  I'm an actor right now I'm doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and that sort of thing  well my parents are both artsy people and I grew up around it and for a long time I was singing and then I was went to study musical theater and somewhere along the line they realize that acting was more my bag than singing I suppose but I still do both  now I don't  I don't usually have trouble talking to people I'm pretty friendly I can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within 5 minutes of meeting me how much I feel like is Mark of an extrovert  I took a bath or read a book go out with my friends  go to the theater  sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or and he's not going for a walk  yoga  things that makes me mad  Injustice I can be very righteously indignant I suppose  people who don't see those things that people who have like entitlement I think entitlement incentive privilege that can make me mad yeah  it depends I usually a lot of times it's I argue my case I guess all right I call my best friend usually and complain talk to her about it  pretty good pretty good I don't have too much of a temper  like a real argument or like a debate  if it was a real argument probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argue about why we broke up stupid things like that  I think I was kind of  over it by then but it wasn't times  that's why I felt really happy  was  really happy  probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night had a good time  my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything she would describe me as  compassionate and having a strong sense of who I am  I think yeah she also said she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that's something that she  make fun of me for because I do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that I have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing I think that we have a very good relationship  yeah yeah it has it's not terrible trouble but but yeah it's got me in trouble for sure  I haven't  no but I think I had it  but I never went to a doctor cuz I had a I had a traumatic situation where somebody injured me and I when I looked up PTSD later I realized I felt like I had all of the symptoms of like going back in a situation like that I would get panicky and it was very I held onto it for a really really long time I think I think that I did have it but I just I don't know cuz I never I never saw anyone about it  sometimes yeah certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or it happened in a in an acting class so sometimes certain teachers if they criticize in a certain way I start to I start to panic even if they're totally right and I know they're right and like it's something that someone else could tell me and I'd be fine with it sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky  well I mean my dad is sick so not great  but but considering not terrible  i've been having bad dreams  apps like stress dreams I think having to do with my dad  I getting kidnapped and my teeth falling out things that if you look them up always say like there's something out of your control she's slick exactly what it is so  it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so  which way  easy very easy  I am tired and irritable goofy I get really goofy  yeah  I  and fairly non-judgmental of other people like I stay open-minded I can make most people laugh funny creative  I  that is some of the best ones I'd say  I love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning and just getting out of the routine I like staying in hotels I like most things about traveling I even I even like flying I like all of it  well I just finished eighth or a couple months ago going up and down the east coast and then across the u.s. send performing for kids all over yeah and then we ended up here in LA  yeah yeah it was great as a good time  I think we  we went to  the hot springs the naturally occurring hot springs in Colorado and that was really nice I was a nice way to unwind  a lot of people I I would say my dad comes to mind certainly my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well  my best friend my best friend from high school I think I set a few of my best friends from high school and college that I kind of grown up with and become Who I Am with them  Small Things sure  I regret  the way that I dealt with  a friendship that was ending once I regret committing to certain people that have dated  but nothing huge I tend to go well I won't do that again but I don't spend a lot of time like being upset about things I've done in the past  stand up for yourself  don't date felons  I think that I  I don't have any trouble standing up for things that I believe in but sometimes I have trouble standing up for myself I think I I really internalized the idea of like you know women being too needy or or I don't know those kinds of things and then and so as as an adolescent and growing up I felt like well you didn't you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me awhile to be able to like a voice what I want what I needed from other people and be okay with that and still something to work on  I'm glad you think so  I could question  my friends and family  and  add my talents I would say  yeah yeah my ability to take situations and  take bad situations and continue and make the best of everything  all right  thank you  goodbye goodbye,12
336,sound  okay  yeah  feel like The Matrix  virtual  well you know  okay  oh okay  okay alright what do I say  okay  hello  are you okay with this sure  good little tired  Indianapolis Indiana  I'm a singer  I like singing  diversity my girlfriends  from Taiwan so dealing with different cultures  the traffic the crazy people  it's hard to get anything really accomplished  it took me about six months just to figure out the directions  28 years ago  a long time  haven't been there in about 8 or 10 years  well I don't like my brother so I don't want to hang around him  I started my girlfriend we did about just went back got back from Orlando and she likes to travel so  be new people see new places helps me to get out of LA and get a different perspective  I just did the Avatar seminar which is like  raise your Consciousness and  clean out the crap in your head  yeah I feel better if I have a lot of psyche could tag and it says I'm psychic so it's very hard to deal with it  well  there's more to life than what you see so  a lot of things are in other dimensions and other places so had to deal with not only the emotions but people Direct Energy at you  well to do a lot of clearing and grounding and stay true to yourself  I'm both  well I'm introverted because I like to spend time by myself and I'm extroverted cuz I like to meet new people used to be totally and introverted  watch movies watch TV read new crosswords I'm a singer sing right music I'm writing a novel  it serves like The Matrix  awesome  why I wrote the first 20 Pages pretty quick  so now I'm expanding it  I get inspiration it was actually a dream and then I wrote down the dream and now it's becoming could probably turn it into a movie  yeah  people don't respect me it's the number one  no I just did my brothers they don't respect me they don't really  you know I went to love my family in but I don't want to hang around my brother's what's a conflict  exactly  pretty good I only get mad about once a year  my girlfriend about 2-3 months ago  she was wanting me to do something and I said no  oh yeah  she's my girlfriend I know her for about a year now  pretty close  one time I was singing and  and I was singing to an audience that was great  well I'm looking into ways to expand my Consciousness so that I can have more money and more abundance in my life so I can  have my own house and live in my own creative space  singing I'm a singer so Unforgettable so that's where I like to do  no  no  no  well that's the hard part is I don't  I don't know maybe it's because when I was a kid my brother's beat me up and I don't feel totally rested in my cell for my life so  I feel like  I don't feel totally safe  yeah  a little irritable  I have been sleeping better since I met my girlfriend so I totally bad  the way  Behavior what  all right  I feel more positive I did the seminar and  so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain and be more positive about life  what did a lot of exercises to  reduce my stress and lower my stress comes from judging myself and other people  yeah you could say that  well  I don't know it's hard  how to deal with sometimes have sometimes much too critical for my own good  well  watching TV gets up  oh wait we are used to feeling like I need to  have less judgement and more fun  why did that seminar  about a week ago I think  why with the seminar I got there and I was able to take off work  being a different environment cuz my job is stressful and  my life is stressful so I was able to take a break which is great  Tim outgoing find smart  but I mean they're laid people in LA are they don't post them don't want to spend time with you  now that's because of me or LA  that I spent a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward  avoid it yeah I'm watching TV or going to see movies or try not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem  a little bit of it paid my bills a lot of money so it's kind of a self-defeating props prophecy  stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen  my girlfriend's been really helpful  what is funny and she loves me and cares me about me and  yeah  I'm singer and I'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and I'm a good listener  Riverton about 4-5 books  my voice setting remember one cuz when I started have much of a singing voice but now I do  okay bye  bye  doorbell  yeah  okay can I take you up yeah,7
337,virtuous are you okay  yeah  I'm doing okay how are you doing  I'm originally from like a suburb of LA from the San Gabriel Valley  I like the diversity I like the vibe of the city I've lived other places and just not  as happy here I feel like I can really Thrive here so I just like la like all the things that are so close together and there's a lot of interesting things are totally different parts of the city 2 miles away from each other  don't like the traffic. Like all the cars but I can live with it I mean there's not that much I don't like  aesthetic music vocal performance the study music technology things like that  yes  right now I sing an opera company but my I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera so I do have a day job and work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if I get a call I can call in and change my shift very easily actually pretty good gig  they do some technology gigs sometimes yes you do some recording some live sound stuff but I'm kind of want to get away from that do some video work sometimes but again I want to get away from that don't go back to the because I find that performing more is more interesting I like being Talent where they like being crew  so I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life  okay  you consider yourself  sometimes mean repair my personal life yeah they do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people but if I'm at home rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family don't really have too many close friends but yeah you know  I rather keep to myself  a moderately close to the family that I have laughed have actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so but like thank you but like my gym clothes to my husband and and  I've got a couple of cousin I talk to you and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to you a bit but it's not like we're interacting everyday close together  but it's somewhat close  mostly I saying or I read or write or  hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but they try to do that and try to  clear everything and see what starts coming back in and  sometimes a heart sometimes that doesn't but mostly creating things contacting my family through Facebook or whatever works but  most of my free time I create things  I like to travel more I travel by car a lot new my idea of  like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and I like to travel more  I'd like to travel for work things or whatever but I don't get as much an opportunity as I would like to travel  sea of particulate driving my car seem like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you feeling the vibrations of the area change like just seeing what's out there and I know that there's a bigger World outside of  where I am and where I live in my world and like to see that  but I like to leave that to go back to my world  a trip I'd like to take us to make the drive from here to Nevada weather I go all the way to Vegas or just go to Stateline  my cousin and I would take what we call exit one trip because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so would take those we just sort of impromptu would like a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that I like make could take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  too close to home but not  but not close to home close to home but it was still a world away so that cuz I don't really have time to take like a two-week vacation or whatever little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head think like that mean cuz there's sort of a sense of meditation and then that you get on a highway that you can get driving the freeway so I like doing that  the last time that happened was May of last year so I might be able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who is 10 years younger than I am and we kind of grew up like sisters and I was about to move away from the Inland Empire which is where they live so kind of took me on a last hurrah when we drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back cuz I actually lived in Vegas for a while but I don't like it so it's kind of a social to some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was an overnight trip but we are driving the entire time  it's kind of interesting  things are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or two children or the animals people who can't fight back and I mean to them just because they can't fight back  and  actually  like to see people who are  as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you  so I think that's one thing this makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason and I'm not good for people who can't fight back a few people who've done nothing to deserve it  that kind of really just makes me mad  okay  but I'm annoyed I'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situations to start following me then I'll wind up lashing out somehow either  are verbally just  cutting them with a quipper you know really just I really will yell at somebody  but I'll try to if I try to walk away and diffuse it if that doesn't work they don't let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me  not like legal trouble or anything because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone  there's not really like big trouble but cuz it cuz it's it is off-putting and it's not an expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reactions I know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if it's is trouble issues of trouble that is from mad that other person's perspective and doesn't affect me at all because do the situation I can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone and walk away from it  the last time I argued with somebody  Hurt Like a Prayer like a family member or an outsider or somebody not  the last thing I could think of was  a argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law cuz she's got dementia and so we were the reason we came out here from the Inland Empire with take care of her she won't go anywhere but LA and she is like hardcore Angelino like we know we are that wear that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere but so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is cuz she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what you want cuz he's a mama's boy like I am I'm a mama's girl you know I lost my mom like four years ago I'm still a mama's girl and I'll standing still and I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much that's what they wants you want to get it for him and because you don't they you know that happened when you were going up with me try to give you what you want because you wanted it and you want to do that for them now they started giving back to them somebody that you care about me you feel deserves it  but it's kind of dangerous for you know I don't want this thing to happen to her yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as you can so I know it seems that she has is going to erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give a 24-hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves it's not that bad but it's getting where she really should has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most of time with her and I go back to our house and it gets stressful and it gets annoying because it's I do I handle the outside things are run the errand to take her to the store things like that he does the day-to-day things make sure she has she eats make sure she has clean clothes things like that  so me it's a partnership it to its  a dual effort is very much to do effort but I would like her to move in with us so that was that's like  a source of not really like yelling screaming argument but Lively discussion and debate  not insurmountable mean life's not going to be easy ever and if it is at when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things in your present your life is not going to be easy you deal with it and move on  the most positive influence to think I've been probably my mother and my grandmother cuz my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually  gave me a lot of confidence and but we're realistic about it  I mean I think I have sort of a  realistic serve a downer temperament to myself that they that they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that you know life's going to go on and my mom would say to me when you're forty or fourty whether you working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life I think that was a big influence and how it with I was like my life since she has passed  I regret not taking care of myself in the last year my mother's life because I think I may have clouded some of my decisions know it do have underlying conditions everyone in my family is diabetic I didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so I didn't eat ride I didn't take my insulin right on my wanted making myself insulin resistant that that you're just because my blood sugar was so high for a like a year eating just horrible Foods when I did eat so it really took it really actually made myself very sick and I'm wondering well if I didn't if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straighten my my vision in my thoughts weren't complete run clouded  what I made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed them when she needed me to be to step in and make this is for because she wound up having a health catastrophe she had kidney we said can you damage I want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider miss that so she wanted having sort of this hole  catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wanted having a stroke at like 51 small stroke and it just kind of went down from there something while if I didn't if I had taken care of better care of myself but I've been able to take better care of her  I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death what I say if I what I've been able to make it easier on her  if I would have taken care of myself that's like one huge regret that I have  oh I know I am but it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and I know other people I can't really direct them into my own Vision because they're their own  individual beings  and they can't you know be what I want them to be and I know they're not going to be  but I still have you know my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but I know there are other beings and I'm not going to be able to do that for them then I can build you up for me but it still buy ideals so I have to sometimes have to look at it going well is this what I want because I want it or what is what they want and what's their is their decision or mine and she's it's theirs I know it's there so if you really care about somebody you're just going to support them and go with them but  it still  kind of hard for me and I know I got to get over it  10 or 20 years ago  probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I want up taking care of my mother mean she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and had a job lined up and had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her I think would have been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her getting my own job history of my own credit history thing like to think like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years  so I figured I probably would have done that  Potomac do that and keep who you are and learn to separate  you're who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself that's probably what I would have induced things for yourself to keep that you sent of yourself that's probably what are we giving myself 10 years ago  no  no  I know but probably cuz I haven't gone to a doctor about it cuz I don't want to know  I mean it's not I know there were times in my life where I've been severely depressed and usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but I'd rather pull myself out of it for resorting to treatment  after my mother had died may have been this long battle for a year that we lost and I didn't know  if I if I was to blame for that it's like logically knew I wasn't but  how can I convince myself of that  two weeks after she died I want up with  pulmonary embolisms in one in each long because I didn't take care of myself for year that they are all I'm 30 years old if you know whatever I do myself I can get over no turned out but I want up having to take more medication because of that it's been a fight to get my own house back to get to be able to get out of that depression cuz so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter office and I didn't like  the rug was pulled out my like button fell into my world after that so that was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression I'm I almost got divorced because of bad because I didn't want anything anymore so I know his ex being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point I started getting very distant from him pushing everything away.  And feel what am I going to do with the rest of my life now  and  Ben  a fight and then you be there times and no I couldn't get up  stay in bed and sleep all day but then realizing that  when my mother died I had forecast like after 2 or mine to rehearse so I went up adopting the two that were hers because they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you want to play  I took that responsibility of doing it for them  so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them I mean I could go without eating I could go that taken care of myself but they couldn't they didn't nail so they are they actually got me up and  and they made me go out and face things even though didn't want to ditch didn't just kind of want to curl up and die but that would have been my choice not theirs and they I mean what would happen to them if I was there to take care of them they would have been sent to a shelter or whatever probably and maybe they would have not been re-adopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for for me meaning for me making a selfish decisions so it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself a bit  nuts Acumen a motivating factor is cuz I figured out that it was just me I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff in my car if I wanted it wouldn't be big deal I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life but  I have a family to look after now so I have to go out and do things and I have to go out and look for legitimate work you know dating your day job have to let you know but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because his what I want to do with my wife but yet I have to take care of my family some homework on a balance of the two  very but it's worth it I mean  it would be very I have a lot less things to worry about if I just looked at my car and said forget it  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's difficult but you have to do it if you want you want any if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  I am and I know that but it gets hard sometimes you do want to give up but then it's like wall what's the alternative  I mean I don't think I can live a comfortable life  if I did I wouldn't do anything I have to be slightly uncomfortable or am I going to do anything with myself I'm just going to be content just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with Mike catherwood ever  and it wouldn't get anything done  a very anxious and nervous and mean what if  I don't find  enough you went off work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if  yo what what if I can't  keep  a semblance of stability in my life and it's actually hard work to be stabled and I know it's hard work to be stable but  what's answers a lot of what-ifs and anything it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and I know that but it's still have it still protects that's actually  a source of  anxiety  anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but I know it is a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and oh my God what am I going to do what am I going to do the same okay what is  the fundamental thing I need to take care of here  me when what is just extraneous and what can what is what are the actual not issues and what is the actual issue and so figure figure things out that way and then things i t shirt to go with a little bit but then something will pop up in the what if so come up again I'll have to  figure it out again but I know it's a cycle I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it you get over it pretty quickly get through it  the last time I felt really happy  I don't know  huh could question like that actually surprisingly stumped me because I do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much as I just cannae and the middle  really like over joyously happy I don't know  if not I can't think of when that happened  I don't know you don't know perceptions of other people mean  probably a somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid-back and  handle things as they come but I don't see myself as at at all  as it is  probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to  hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to do to survive and get things done  that  and I can do it creatively and I try to  strive for balance  play the best things about me  then I'm doing basically what I want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  I am not financially well-off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives cuz I have an aunt that I really don't talk to who and the reason why I don't talk to her because she's always miserable mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into cuz my older aunt loves animals but didn't want to be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time  but her know she tried to get arthritis in her hands and she had that should my cousin's father went and cut a  stole all the money for her business so she lost your business and she kind of it she retired early cuz between that and that's why does she want to retiring early she employed my younger Aunt who is still a dog groomer but she hates it and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  and I think the thing I'm most proud of is  yeah I'm not as financially well-off as she is but I'm doing what I want with my life you know I can be creative I can have creative people around me people who actually like to talk to around me people actually like in my life and be happy with that and they see a lot of people who aren't and then it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of Southside tracking to be able to say I'm not like that that I'm actually doing what I want even though their sacrifices I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now  thank you  thank you goodbye,10

339,and I want to start up the virtual human to chat with you for a bit and when she said she'll let you know I'll put the  okay  yes  I'm okay  I was born in San Bernardino California  yes  I'm staying with her sister in North Hollywood  she makes it as comfortable as possible  oh I love the weather  and the entertainment and the public transportation  it's very difficult to find full-time employment  and some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the South cuz I lived in the South before  knossos only two things  no I don't  I was an English major in college  I haven't finished yes I am  I'd like to be a recording singer  yes  I've always loved to sing from the time that I was a child  at times  tell me about  when I'm alone I am extremely  I guess I would say  intermind it like I have a lot of thoughts and I keep them to myself  so  if I'm in that mode then I don't really interact with people but I can also in a wreck with people if I change modes  I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago  and  last week on Thursday no on Tuesday  usually I  just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation if it's a person or if it's a situation that I'm dealing with myself that's annoying I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better  come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed  pretty good  I may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness like meeting on time and showing up on time and it was actually last Monday  no  to just be cautious of people's intentions  then to listen really well cuz people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it  I'm a good listener patient fun-loving  generous  depressed sometimes  but generally a good person  no I have not  yes  found within a year-and-a-half ago  I just knew that  I often thought about situations that happened in the past and  kind of blame the situation for my future and all  certain settings  I'm if I see certain types of individuals and certain settings it just reminds me of when I was younger when things happened and changed my future plans so I tried it I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time but now I feel like I just handled things better as far as  being in the similar settings with similar people I just handled those things better  I do  I'd like to believe that it does  I don't worry as much  it's just allow me to know that actually speaking about the issues  Release Me of the tension of holding them inside so  that's how it's helped me  at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it  it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring if I'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual it relieves me of the stress of of a trying to figure out everything alone and oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I'm hearing myself speak up the issue  I was diagnosed with depression and my doctor felt that I should probably see the therapist  I am  it depends if I'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do I often try to plan things and if I'm planning things it affect my sleep I might wake up in the middle of the night so  sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't  irritable  just very irritable  I was feeling anxious but now I'm calmer  today I don't but I have in the past week  because I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so I was becoming anxious  thank you  yes  maybe in October  when my mother first came and she came to visit me in October and when she first got here we had a good time the first couple of days so I was happy to see her I hadn't seen her in over a year  I'm proud that I'm able to adjust to different situations the older I've gotten the more adapt the bowl I am in different environments in different situations and learned how to be more resourceful so I'm proud of that  I'm sorry  my dad my sister she's positive cuz she's finished her master's degree  my mom sometime my best friend is very positive cuz she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it that's an inspiration  when someone lies consistently  I listened very very well sometimes I give good advice I'm a good friend I normally do the things that I say I'm going to do so I'm Dependable my communicate well and  I enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in Good Moods  being around positive people music foot me in a good mood comedy shows put me in a good mood good food puts me in a good mood  when I graduated from high school  it was a really good I'll never forget it was wonderful day  very confident accomplished and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future  you're welcome,11

344,to do another thing that  oh wow  Samsung one more time I realize  who started the virtual human  okay  okay  I thank you ma'am  are you okay  yes  I'm okay  how far am i Los Angeles California recently  yes  sunshine the weather is great  got it  small collusion crime  certain things like that yeah  I dated one point in my life I was in the military so I don't do hardly a lot of traveling no more  seeing different sites different people I think it's more of the people and being around different types of city and the Pepsi meeting different new people  I travel to  New York one time and it was quite different big city  different people it's about it  18  yes I was  I know I did a lot of combat training but no contact  discipline more  more motivated you get a lot of things done more even when you don't want to do them you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that day that you really needed to get done but you didn't want to do it but they got there  like  you had to do a lot of cleaning you had to wake up pretty early you had to do a lot of PT you had to stay up to like 2 or 3 in the morning and you didn't wake back up until 4:05  starting point yes  after the military I join the National Guard and I did 15 16 years and there I was  excuse me ma'am I didn't hear the choir that one  what made me decide to do that just the motivation just me and I'll really wanted a career see if I could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit you  thank you  it wasn't that easy  I mean I'm sorry it was easy it didn't bother me too much to go back to the civilian life  yeah I didn't bother me at all I just adjusted pretty well  history basically a lot  just basically history  no I'm not disabled  oh no it's okay it's okay we can go I can heal I can get better hopefully I will  yes I try to keep up  scooter man  I guess my dream job will probably be working with others working with young people working with kids saying that they get the right and proper education that you know  that's due to them so they can be productive in life of society as we live in today  excuse me  what I think about him I think they should be more more I mean they should listen to piss up eight more and what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to really achieve something within their lives to give them to give them the confidence in the motivation they need a life cuz I don't get it  when I see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing  it really eats me I mean really bothers me and when people talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just give me the runaround when you just be straight up with me. I can be very frustrating and real when people to really I'm trying to find the right words to good stuff that really bothers me too  spray painting on the wall  Jess  going garbage anywhere not picking it up not really being you know not really being  hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what I mean  when I do when I'm annoyed I get really upset I really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and it's something that's not really me but I'm learning to really let go of it a lot to know just so you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like I'm not in control I can't control it  yeah I only have to control the things about what I do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good it's not good for me  all my Timbers camping control I can show the pretty well  I think it probably would but my sister and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and I have mine don't tell me what to do  yeah  we were so close I can get along with him for real clothes I have no problems with them  yeah very good  this morning  yeah wake up pretty you know out at first thing I do when I wake up in the morning I pray so we'll Nice Spirits in connection with the the universe in the world I feel pretty good  yes  up and down Uno up because I'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life and just not doing anything at all and then the times where you want to get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's Roblox in the way but I'm learning how to overcome those roadblocks as well  well for instance looking to go to school and I was having problems getting enrolled in school I was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and the do it so I'm like okay it was going to get done  yeah  can you repeat that one more time out  yes I have  that had to be the last couple of weeks I noticed that I go through certain situations like he was talking about the anger situation is like I don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when I get angry I have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry  and I have to take Schism now  it's not hard at all cuz you have to do is just take your time in the reflect about everything that you have gone through and take a good look at the situation and and then go from there and find out what's really bothering you  it's very seldom I suffer from PTSD and getting that type of sleep would be would be great  because I have recurring nightmare so of an incident so  I I think it is and I don't know what is triggered by but I think it is and that's why I'm talking to someone or seeing someone cuz I'm a veteran at the VA about the situation now  about to PTSD basically right now  change mail  a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues depression I noticed all this in me and  I started. Just started to just tell myself I need it out  and as that's basically I just so you know I just you know I did something wrong with the one right with me and when something's not right with me I have to take time out to just take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you did something right then that's fine something not right then you need to take care of it and just start shaking help down there yeah  someone yes it is someone  because I'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist  well I'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and tell him I situation and we usually will go over to the problem and I went to classes I've been to talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping a little bit  yeah that's a good thing  sketch map  no no not really  my best friend  they he will describe me as a fun-loving good person always there. Try to help others think more about is really them more myself but when I know I needed things need to be done for me I take care of it so you know they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me  yeah they see something in me they wished that they at  gmail  can you be a little bit more specific  okay  books crossword puzzles walking that's about it  I thought I did but I don't think I do I don't think I regret anything because  this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so I accept it and I keep moving on  because if I regret anything in the past then I'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past I need to move on I need to live in the present so I can be prepared for the future like move on to the Future  yeah  more education  being more direct and more confidence in what I'm doing like I am today so yeah that's what I was lacking maybe 20 years ago  yes I have had a lot of pots of the people been been in my life  yes I'm people with can consistently motivate me to continuing to pursue a certain goal and I thought that was pretty good because I really don't see that a lot and  they gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do so I can think of anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done  excuse me ma'am  that I'm able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished. Thought I couldn't but it can be accomplished if I'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it  Paul wow huh  oh really and you know what I really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and we're talkin about getting things done within my life and school was one of them and just being just school was one of my kind of liked it that because I was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me  yeah and I thought that was a great dane so as long as you're willing to do that and I'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school  and then then that's what gets me going  so it is and I love it and this is going to be accomplished  thank you  goodbye  yeah I think she's through  jackass she was really human wow before technology,11

346,"how to start up a virtual human and she's going to chat with you for a bit  okay  thank you  yes  I'm okay  hey Los Angeles  there's a lot of things to do I love the beach I love the I love it sunny all the time  I'm the amount of people  that's really about it behind of people  just a little  I just like going to new places and just discovering new things  I recently went to New York I was there for about three months and it was extremely boring I went to Western New York and it was extremely a snowy and it was an imposition why I didn't have a car so I can get to go very many places and I was in a small town so I  it was beautiful for what I got to see but really it wasn't really much to it  yeah  both I'm both an introvert and an extrovert  I really enjoy doing things for myself I have a lot of my own up my likes and dislikes and I spend a lot of time alone even though I had you have a lot of friends and when I do go out I I do tend to meet a lot of people but I also enjoy being by myself a lot  probably outgoing creative  talented fun trustworthy  I studied language and physics and  math  no I'm not I'm actually I'm up I'm trying to be an actress  I was something that I fell into when I was a teenager  and I really enjoyed doing it I hadn't done it for years so I figured why not I just came back to California to might as well try something that I did enjoy really doing  are you happy  so far I just got picked up by an agent so I haven't really done anything yet as an adult  I'm hoping hoping something it'll be fruitful  I really don't have and have too many  I guess my sister she's done really well  my boyfriend he's a  he's a very positive human being but really I haven't had too many positive influences  I'm close I mean we hang out I don't tell them everything they're kind of judgmental but other than that I mean I mean we hang out I mean I see them everyday  cheese  it's kind of hard for me to relax, try to watch TV and I read a lot  tell me about it I read I do a lot of sleeping I'm a little depressed so yeah it's kind of like I said it's really hard for me to relax  it isn't I tend to think a lot about things that stress me out been through a lot of a lot of stuff so I  yes I I don't I don't I don't sleep very well tonight and if I do fall asleep I wake up other than I usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  I dream a lot about the stuff that has a has affected me throughout the years so  usually Unocal dream about something that stressed me out and then I'll wake up and make my chest to hurt or just I just can't sleep all night because I just think it seemed to be I don't know if I'm afraid to go to sleep but I  I just I don't know I feel like they've got the vulnerable place for me because of stuff that have happened to me so  so I sleeping is just not really something I do well  tired I'm in a moody is very sensitive  yeah I'm just not a negative person which really that's not me  yeah I'm judgemental is not me either I just I'm just not a not a nice person to be around  I tried I spent a lot of my time reading I try to go out and do I force myself to go out and do things just to keep myself involved so that I don't just sit around in the end and dwell on the fact that I can't sleep and I try to get myself is exhausted as I possibly can buy running around and doing things  it's difficult I do like there is a part of me that doesn't want to I don't really want to go out and do things I have to actually force myself to if I have make appointment I got I make appointments just like for auditions or leaving to do this I am I attend to  just not like at the last minute I'll try to convince myself not to go but then I force myself to you anyways  I've been diagnosed for two instances I was diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago and then I was diagnosed again in August  the first time it was  I just wasn't because of the not sleeping and Leah Justice of the unbelievable stress and then the second time it was going to start with the not sleeping and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me  and I just like I just couldn't take it anymore so I figured I was getting too gloomy I was getting I come  not thinking life was worth it and I guess I just needed to see somebody before anyting escalated  yeah it was  find I do not  one of the reasons I went to New York was to try to get out of my environment and I'm not seem to help a lot and I'm out here I I was I just the counselors that I was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much they just they just seem to be giving me a lot of medication and I don't believe that that's what I needed yeah so stressed lately I've been really sad and I don't know why  but like I said I've been trying to combat that by keeping myself busy  actually I'm kind of a couple days ago  I was actually really happen it was genuinely happy but then I went back to being you going back to feeling miserable  I realized  I got up in the morning I actually did get a good night of sleep and  I realized that I'm actually really lucky  cuz I've been through a lot in my life and I have somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who is finally there for me and  you know gives me what I need emotionally and I was just really thankful for by and that made me really happy  yeah  thank you  Oggi's  I've had so many years of just  just bad there's a lot of bad that there has been a long time since I've been proud of anything I guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships I've been through  a lesser person I guess would have gotten rid of themselves a long time ago but even though like I'm really depressed and I feel gloomy and I just feel miserable about a lot of things there's got to be a silver lining  so  so yeah so me and like I guess that's what I'm proud of that  although whole bunch of bad things happen to me and hasn't ruined me I still try to be a good person and try not to be negative towards other people and  untruthful and I still I still have Drive-In me  huh so much  I lost marriage  I'm not getting out when I should have  Panda just  I regret a lot  the any situation that would have had a red flag  just get out of it you know some things just don't work and  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so I I I would tell myself to  it's not selfish to let go of a bad situation and not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just got to live for yourself and help yourself so I know not done had I known that then I I I probably would have done better in life  people who  when people are down on me for my faults that I have done that I have things that I've done in my past that people steal still relive when I'm trying to forgive myself people who are mean to other people people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy  just anybody who pick some a little guy you know people who don't care about the environment or animals  I just I think that everybody should be as good as I possibly can be and it's it's disheartening and it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make everybody feel is negative and it's partly if they do and that makes me mad  event July 10th event and then  and then and then it's usually over I try not to bad-mouth people  I try to just talk through it until until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore  I tried not to get angry because I have a really bad temper and did  and I can get out of hand so what I do is I I have something gets me so mad I tend to go and take a nap I'm not in that situation where I can just go and I usually just walk away from the situation and I try to clear my mind and come back to it  it was a couple days ago it was actually my mother it was about  actually she thought that I had taken a shirt from her and she was screaming and yelling at me and I was I was tired of my was it was late and I started to yell back at her unit because I was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty  any  it's a going back to my past you know when I was younger in and I didn't care about you know people's things and I would just kind of take and do whatever I wanted to and I'm not so far from that person and it hurt me so I got mad and I think I started to yell and argue  kind of petty and stupid but at the time it seemed seemed viable  my most memorable experiences  I've had so many  Maybe  it was  I don't know  it was  probably graduating pharmacy school  I felt pretty great I didn't know if I was doing very very well or not and I ended up getting like on my last test scores I get end up getting like 98% and  I actually I did had no confidence that I had done it well it and class in school at all and I I didn't even know I was getting the grades I was getting so that was a really big accomplishment for me  and yeah that was great it was a great memory  unreliable  I am  I'm talented I  I'm a good listener I'm always there to help people I tend to always try to do the right thing  sometimes I actually forget that I have any good qualities but  I'm just  I am around that try to be you know his is good in the best person that I can meet other people and myself  Gwen, shows  just them  having moments where you just laugh with people  sometimes just rating puts me in a good mood  play that's about it  thank you",23

350,virtual human she's in chat with you for a bit okay  okay  okay  are you okay  yes  how do I find thank you  originally I'm from well I was born in Mississippi so I'm from Gulfport Mississippi  yes  I didn't have a choice I was a child I moved here with my parents  when I was 2 years old  if I was I was a toddler  yeah if I like to travel and I travel a lot  being around new environments and new people different things  well one of my favorite trips was visiting Africa and I think 2006 I visited West Africa that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and give medical assistance to people  a friend of mine was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so I went with her and it went from there so I don't know I made the decision that way  I am I am happy I did that it's something I'll never forget  I studied English and education so that I could teach high school students  not currently no  well right now I tutor privately for private Tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher  wow anything that combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so tell anything I can buy and sell those three items so teaching has the closest I've come to that  okay  occasionally f  I don't know I guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing and and a lot of people have said I seem reserved our kind of introverted I don't know  well  I don't know I read them I just started meditation  try to breathe and calm down  things that make me really mad  mistreatment of children  abusive children  try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there if I can control not being annoyed by ultimately I control that whether or not I'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not being if I can help it at all  no I'm fine. Control tank at controlling my temper I think so I don't have  the last time I argue with someone  I was  I don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about  it was about a smell they had on their clothes but I thought it smelled like perfume and they said and did not  of course I think I'm very close to my family we're pretty close-knit family talk everyday see each other most everyday  there been a lot of positive influences in my life I would say my aunt and definitely my mother have all been positive influences  more about that  well I look look up to my eye I think she's positive I look up to her because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and area is and she's very successful despite the types of things that we've gone through as children and she doesn't let her pass to find her future my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well and she has some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she still tries to  no overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so I look up to people who are able to know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible  military no I have not  no  I have  well I was diagnosed with in the last year and then again most recently within the last 3 months  well fear and just not knowing what to do with some of the things I was feeling and not knowing  you know why I couldn't stop feeling the way I was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms on  you know mostly I gained a lot of weight I couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes I could sleep too much  so sad sometimes  like I want to cry a lot  feeling okay I'm more days you have I don't know every day is different so I mean today I feel fine but like I said everything's differently and lately I've been feeling more like I command them involved in my own life and like I want to get  thousand do more things  no no no not any different from before what I was experiencing before  no  well I was receiving  I got a Psychotherapy and I don't know a lot of things happened I moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and I just kind of got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  but sometimes  I do yes it is  it's kind of difficult I either have a hard time falling asleep or hard time staying asleep  I'm sure it is I just don't know what it is as of yet because I usually had some thoughts continue with thoughts running through my mind. Either keep me up or make it hard for me to go to sleep or I'll make it hard for you to stay asleep  journal sometimes that might help if I can write something down and get it out that helps  other than that I don't know haven't found any really great way to coping  Tire  mostly tired  kind of confused  I don't know for the most part I feel happy it's just I'm  last time I felt really happy was I guess over the holidays  I'd love to hear all about it  I don't know I guess just being around family and friends just the holiday season I guess in general that's just a happy time for me and some people I haven't seen in awhile  talk about it  call my best friend describe me probably as  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes tenacious I don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because I'm caring and compassionate are easy to talk to  that I might him over so I can sister to them  everyone has regrets I'm sure yeah I guess so  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and I don't mean to sound that way but it's true is just we have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you I'm to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their their time and their progression to how they get two things so I would tell me 10 years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that I want from my life and don't be  I'm really enjoyed working with okay that's fine project with my younger relatives my cousin's we did a science project together and that was fun despite the mess we made those ball  being the first to attend college in my family and then I'm going to college and coming back to the community where I went to school and then teaching and not community and volunteering in our community and helping youth or children that come from the same background that I came from so I'm most proud of being able to  to have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and  help someone else improve them better themselves as well  I think I got everything on YouTube  your pie  that is really cool,11
351,baby girl  are you okay  yes  okay  New York  The Pursuit music industry job in the music industry  oh yes  I'm self-employed  what's your dream job  how to become a music producer  awesome  it's pretty hard as a lot of competition  to pursue a job  owain about a year ago last February  it was pretty difficult East Coast is a lot different than the West Coast  I think I've been there twice in the past year  no more creature of habit  yes  sometimes I feel like I don't fit into the crowd so it's better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of going in and actively pursue things  probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs  probably people being in  not very very nice to me or seeing in justices or  I think that's about it  pretty good  probably a couple of days ago one of my friends was saying that they were making a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about that  yeah it does  pretty close  my best friend so I will just one of my friends  and quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when I overreact usually  it's pretty hard I rather the person notice that I'm kind of getting withdrawn and actively engaging me instead of getting to the point where it's like it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  probably spending time with my family  a New York  very close  my sister and my brother  I know they're just great people  and I love them a lot and they're a lot like me so I feel like I have people that understand me  probably  Castle oil sensitive I don't know it's kind of hard to hard question  no  no  yes  gosh I think probably 1997 so a long time ago  I'm just during that time I was just going through a lot of issues and I was feeling unsafe to myself so I ended up going to the doctor can you get meds and have therapy and stuff  not currently ended about like 6 months ago  almost filled the therapist wasn't really helping me I thought we kept on talking about the same things over and over and she wasn't really challenging me and I've been in therapy for a really long time so I just knew it was a change  yes I do actually when I feel connected to a therapist and I feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what I'm going through so yes I do  I'm better at describing my emotions and feelings I think the biggest thing is when I'm in situations I can see myself reacting one way and I take a step back and see how it can react normally almost in a way also I tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself those nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know they tell me it's okay basically  feeling hopeless all the time not having enough energy to do things I used to like I had a little bit of concentration issues having weird disturbing thoughts sometime just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kind of crummy about life  sometimes they are like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if I sometimes even seen something on television like sometimes affects me  listening to music or trying to distract myself trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things  it's been a tough transition to come here so we'll be being here so kind of half-and-half okay and not okay  I feel like I've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately but that's about it  some days it's great some days it's not more recently it's been a little bit more difficult  I don't know why I have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night so I tend not to sleep very well and I wake up quite frequently during the night  very groggy in the morning and  that's about it like during the day I tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like why are yawning so much are you just interested in what we're doing and I'm trying to tell them it's not that at all  play Christmas time when I was with my family  just really happy and feeling like everything is alright in my life  have a good sense of Lake where I was at that moment being present with myself  play you know it's a hard question I think probably I can tend to read people kind of wall sometime  I like to say I'm good at being a good friend to people being a good family member  I'm a hard worker when I do have a job so  sure I mean that's life so of course there's regrets one that comes to mind is the wish that I don't eat as much so I can be a lot more healthy  don't take things so seriously enjoy being useful and I think that's it  I don't know ask you a question probably my previous job in my employment I worked really well with kids so I did a great job I thought I was a researcher at a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  yeah who's awesome  I was really kind of like reading people and so I decided to major in Psychology so then I went and worked in the a.m.  mental health facility and did research with them with the most drugs and depression and things like that so I found a good Niche for me  no problem goodbye  hi,14
352,next  are you okay  yes  I'm doing pretty good  I'm from Oklahoma  yep Oklahoma City  the weather is great I love being near the ocean and the palm trees and mountains I just love it here  I was pretty easy there's a few differences of huge City compared to where I'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me  I just always wanted to live in California hated being landlocked in Oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the West Coast be near the ocean  I studied psychology and minor in art  no not at the moment  well actually I think I misunderstood your question I'm not still working on my degree but I am working in the field of psychology I know I just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys to has been in trouble with the law  my dream job  I don't really know I think I just want to help people however I can and I just like working with people in the realm of psychology so I think I may already have my dream job  to relax I like to read and watch movies I like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends  what are some things that  things that make me really mad probably Injustice towards other people people being mistreated or abused and people being lied to and deceived including myself I hate being lied to  limonoid depends on the situation but I tried to just like count to 10 and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions caused me to react in a negative way so I just try and like calm down before I say anything  it depends again on the situation and like who I'm angry with most the time I'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes I think like like most people I lash out at the people that I'm close to the stew at times and those moments I'm not that good at controlling it  when was the last time I argue with someone was probably with my parents I've been having some car trouble lately and I'm also running low on money so I'm sure I don't even remember exactly but I'm sure we kind of probably thought about the fact that I you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent and take care of my own things like car issues  I'm very close with my family they're still in Oklahoma but I talked to them on the phone all the time  oh definitely I mean my mom I think she's probably the person that I'm closest to and she just she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and I just want to be like her in those ways  probably the time I went bungee jumping over the Nile River and Uganda I still kind of have flashbacks of that moment just Free Falling it was like the coolest experience ever and I love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time  yeah well I I have traveled a lot nowadays I don't travel so much anymore but I used to work for a Cruise Line Norwegian Cruise Line so I would go travel all the time with them and then I also did an 11 month long trip around the world is a mission trip so I just went and helped out and different third world countries is really cool  I just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to Branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity in the terrain of the earth even in the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  no I have not served in the military  nope  no I never been formally diagnosed although I would say I probably diagnose myself with depression just after having studied at a lot in Psychology throughout the years I've probably 99% sure that I have struggled with depression and off-and-on so yeah  lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years I've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now I'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  I'm not a private person when I don't sleep well leave is extremely like important for me I think maybe more so than a lot of people I'd I like need good sleep to function  I've been feeling really good over the past several months I was unemployed after coming out here and that was really really tough and I just recently got offered my job just like last week so I definitely think I've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of has lifted off of me because I don't have that pressure any longer of like how am I going to make ends meet the city's really expensive and I don't have a job and so I feel I feel much more relieved than I have been feeling just good  yeah well I mean just like I said over the past week or so I've become a lot more positive I was kind of like feeling a bit like a Hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like I said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of  just like being your own shall I guess and that was kind of how it was how it's been for me and just since I got offered a job I just have so much more confidence in like positivity that things are starting to work out for me up to good  probably a couple of days ago actually I went I went to explore part of the South Bay Area that I hadn't really been to before and it was I was just going to go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and it was just beautiful and then I went for a drive up kind of off the Sleep Cliff for the beautiful scenery that I never seen before and I just like was overwhelmed how pretty it was and I was just like I can't believe that I get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me  my best friend would probably say that I'm very daring and bold and fearless that I'm unique and artistic and I don't I've guess I should probably say that I'm a non-conformist I don't really think the way that a lot of people do and I question everything so it's going to be a good or bad thing but  probably just like the fact that I I really tried to live my life with like no regrets and just I tried to live a very exciting life in a way and I think that especially ever since I finished college and have been traveling like I haven't I've tried moving all different places by myself so I think just the fact that I am not really afraid I don't let things hold me back I just if I want something or if I want to do something I just do it and I guess in a way like I like that about myself in the fact that I'm really independent and can just go and do whatever I feel like doing even if it's hard I still I'm proud that I've overcome a lot of those struggles  oh there's like minor things that I regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major cuz I think pretty much everything that I've done I've learned from whether it's good or bad so I wouldn't really change anything  I would say I would tell myself when I was a kid that I  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything is possible because I guess as I've grown into an adult I've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and then if you really want something you can go after and you can get it and so I would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you want to do  let's see that's kind of hard  oh I guess I went home recently for Christmas back to Oklahoma and I got to see some of my friends from college that I hadn't seen in some of them I haven't seen in like since I graduated so much has been like 4 years ago so it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun  you're welcome by  okay  did she stay up and look okay during that hotel,10
353,yes I'm okay  Pennsylvania  well I was in Boston for a couple years and then I moved here about three and a half years ago but I just wasn't satisfied with call you my life  maybe once or twice last year and got to go back once  a year  definitely safer and definitely Amalur why dismiss it cuz I have lost family back there but Ellie is okay I mean everyone loves the climate here  not too easy I have two really good friends here and I have a boyfriend I've done with for three years so that helps he's from here but it definitely took a bit of adjustment  no  advertising Communications  no I'm currently working and I said I'm not working right now at the moment  I want to be a naturopathic physician  so basically versus Western medicine and naturopathic physician is someone who help someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms for threesome as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look a diet exercise just a variety of things to actually get someone to live a healthier life versus medications are things of a commonly prescribed now and Western medicine  how did you do  well one of the great things was when I came out here to La I was exposed to the debris which I had never heard of living on the East Coast  sometimes  Grand very particular about the people I like to surround myself with and I don't like to socialize with a lot of people I mean I tend to like small intimate groups and I don't tend to like to be in larger a bigger groups  when people don't take an account other people's feelings  I usually  try to go for a walk if I get very irritated  I'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over into Gallery become upset  let's see  I was up with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he's other and I think they're just a little bit mediocre than not the best lawyers  I have no idea  I'm very trustworthy and loyal  I can't read deeply so I like to try to help other people and I would like to try to cheer people up so I think that's I would be some of them  no  yes  just a few months ago about in the last 6 months  I was experiencing  mental issues that I've never really came across the for paranoia and anxiety and I knew that it wasn't  I knew that it wasn't that I can overcome it by myself  a lot better I've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation kind of seeing things from a different purview or and I never purview but a different View and  that's how but there's definitely times where I kind of thing back into thinking about the event especially because the vet cost me the stop working  I think I cannot have a difficulty being in public I'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that's something may happen so so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so I'm not that comfortable going out there in a day at 10 to go out in the mornings and evenings and I don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out  well I've been gradually trying to increase how much I'm outside  and I usually just deep breathing I do a lot of breathing exercises and I just try to stay that basically what I'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real and that  I just I try to try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since the last couple months but before I very much pretty much stayed home  it's been good it's been good to hear someone's feedback but I feel like I've gotten more help with just my inner talk was just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  I do  well I feel more like myself which is a huge Improvement  and I am more  cautious in AeroGarden some ways about my thoughts and about my decisions well I'm not so I'm not so you know I'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that I want in my life  how is your day  it's gotten better I'm okay I'm better now the first three months it was very difficult I couldn't sleep through the night and I woke up maybe two or three times and would be away for a couple hours but now I am sleeping through the night again  groggy feel foggy and out of it  and just low kind of depressed  I think it's been awhile  working I've been a workaholic spending time with my family  yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading  I'm very close  what is that  well my parents cuz he's always been very supporting and loving giving me feedback about my decisions or what I'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own decisions my own choices in life and then my sisters are just always been very you know I just was checking with me I'm the baby I'm the youngest in the family so they always looking out for me and just checking in with me and my boyfriend shoots man with this incident that happened he's been very usually support of what just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when I'm feeling and not wanting to go out and Publican and being aware of that that is not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop for  I'm running errands without having a lot of anxiety  I'm most proud of  the jobs the work that I've done the people I've helped  maybe that I took this job where I was assaulted at that would be it going into retail and to unsafe environment not listening to my gut  what advice would I what  to recklessly pursue your dreams that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  Etsy  well cooking I really enjoy I really enjoy cooking  so I made some roasted vegetables just a time I'm cooking I just really enjoy it we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and some Chili's and cauliflower so just using preparing that for my

355,yes  alright  I was born in Los Angeles California  I want the weather and  the fact that the people aren't so obtrusive like on the East Coast  just the the traffic in the Smoky weather  I used to I'm unemployed now so I'm rarely go anywhere  I have a BS in business with a computer option  I thought that the only place I can get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer message so I took that I took business computer math adoption  I probably be  professional sports player and actor something something that you enjoy doing  I like to ride my bike I like to watch sporting events now I can't afford to go to them so I pretty much watch on TV  I like to travel but like I said I don't have money for that anymore  that's all right  people who are chicken heads they getting their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers expect that from a family member  where are friend but you know fishing with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what Orwell is referring to when he spoke the big brother in 1984  I don't do much him much different than I would otherwise  and I had many temper outbursts  girl you was my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and if you don't know I'd me greatly  I'm kind of on the outs with my parents  the black sheep  I mean my Mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than anybody by far  well I mean she's just me one time when I was in like 15 I went with a friend of mine to see the Crosby Stills Nash and Young concert at the Forum and she has seven kids and she pick me up at the Sizzler is right across the street from the Forum at 11 at night and I couldn't imagine the others had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably  going down to the cape at the end of a Baja Peninsula and Cabo San Lucas or photograph in the bridal veil falls in Yosemite  I was by the two most majestic see sites I've ever seen  it was when I could afford to travel  no  no  I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011 and I took some Lexapro but I stopped after one day I didn't want to do it anymore  no  because I didn't feel it was help I feel I was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years I lost my job in October 2010 and except for you nose job like this which I'm fortunate to get just neon daily things focus groups like that I haven't worked  thank you  Ashley when you're 56 years old  well just get the general feeling of hopelessness  I get out of my bicycle out of walkthrough bikes 4 hours a day spent about 2 hours each  yeah it's good to me  very easy  cuz now I'm old when I was young I couldn't sleep more than 4 6 hours a night  cuz I'm Restless  are you triggered by something no  but now that I'm old I am I sleep much more easily  I pray before I go to sleep and that that's it that's when I can't have any trouble sleeping I just pray beside different prayers like the Lord's prayer Hail Mary stuff like that and I'm leaving to fall off to sleep  I don't know probably  you have any news Civic remembrances  I love that you know it was when I had money to spend I know that and when I had to have a job to have money to spend so it's probably 15 years ago  well  I haven't really enjoyed anything that last week I did a made $75 on that job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and the enlisted people to play  the basically the relatives of people who'd been in this fall bombing at the Staple Center and we you know ask question sign up unit on giving information on missing you no relatives and basically I was provided by the county and they said they went to a routine in downtown LA  that's not hard it was just a just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give this ethics of their characteristics height weight excetera  I don't have a best friend  I'm a very bright I'm a perfectionist at my job  I bet about it  I got a business degree and I'm never been a motivated person I went to school I went to  2 state colleges in two junior colleges to need that in so I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my  anatomiya I guess self-esteem you might say I had something to hang on the wall  yeah I regret you know alienating family members  I would have  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs think thinking that you know I can always get another one and not you know basically blow-off jobs I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for now  Fade Out and locations but I burn Bridges there so that's not possible  thank you  hasta luego,10
356,and I'm going to pull her up and if you let me know if you can see her just fine without your glasses  you know I bet it I think from this distant I think I better  okay  are you okay  yes  okay  come here from from Alhambra  the weather is really nice and everything is very familiar  sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads to too much traffic  hi I studied art and photography  I am it was so much his decision I just kept noticing that I was very interested in it  are you still working in that yes  I'm a photographer  oh I suppose.  Running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business  I know not know I'm in it also an apartment manager keeps me tied down  it's a fair it's not the greatest because of being a department manager I do have free rent but I have to stay  they're a lot so  that part does the refrigerant part is very good  oh gosh  a most memorable experience  it's hard to say  well  I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences  oh well I guess I'm like sports success when I was in high school and a few other things that I was happy about and some art pieces I've made were memorable and  some bad things would be my father's stats right now but those are very memorable not good though  call my parents and have a lot of brothers and sisters so my family  are you to your family  a fairly close the most of them live around at La  I just a few that are from  distant my brother lives in New York and  my other brother lives in Maui  how mostly very talented  just stem more involved in technology then maybe I was or I am and they are  I think they're more of a hive mind and when I grow up SIMs like they were all hooked into social media  hi is going to walk or watch television  carplay with my computer  and I  well  there's some  there's some kind of  Injustice has that happening not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new District parking text kind of upsetting and this city doesn't seem to Anna  I make any exceptions or change the rules  and also some unfair things at work sometimes happened that are  got that are upsetting  oh yeah I work in at a high Sky worked at a high school dance this last weekend and when we arrived at this site  the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it and we had to go outside  and then to get in okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside it delayed our set-up time and that does wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting in  and our work doesn't back us up at the at the office they just need to place the school to maintain the account so often when that something like that happens that means they will not send you out to work at that school again which which translated to less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job  that's how that's how they do things  so that that is upsetting  most of the time that dust off my resume and start looking for other situation Setter yeah  a pretty good are you sure that you might die in the moment I don't really lose it but later I might prevent or something like that went on the on the location I wouldn't do that  well just today we have a tight schedule today and I have a friend that I'm sharing a car with today and we  we were arguing where to go first  10 time so we compromised and did most of her things in one of my things then after this was one of the things this over then we're going to do some of her things  no  post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is  no  yes  what's a 1980  yeah I think Believe It Was 1980 yeah  my father noticed some symptoms my father's is just passed away but it was the psychiatrist  well I wasn't sleeping I was laying around the house  miss waking up at  noon Sunday and I didn't have a focusrite for getting a job it wasn't clear enough I remember some job interviews that I've go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in and I think that was all I'll part of depression  yeah I thought I had a problem but I didn't know what it was  no  well and I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that you thought that I was done it but in it and I I did get too much better place I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so I think I'll have good days and bad days  I think therapy makes you see what the  like that I thought of it as a filter or wearing a as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to I have to sort of try to take the glasses off for a little bit and double-check and my really receiving these things accurately  or am I seeing it through with a depressed few point when I try to look for clues about that  I think I am  slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed. I've noticed in my path in my past and right now we have a work slowdown so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedules too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person I think that structure is really important to get you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people and those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed  well I don't know if it changes its a little bit I said to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting lightsaber but it's more negative like I  I've been sort of thinking about how soldiers in the past I don't know why but like the end during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks how it would have been like to be in the in a Frontline battle with just kind of in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  I don't know I set my mind seems to go there a lot I'm just thinking about that and I've been looking at it and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube  and things like that or some other kind of like terrible Doom type things like I was watching on that animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  we're probably shouldn't dwell so much on that  I am in life in general yeah well  I think I regret not finishing College I think I had a I think I was going into depression right then it wasn't coping in my senior year very well and didn't really I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years but so that's very that's a big regret that I have  I think it would have been to  at certain points I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals just the logistics I had I had was an art major and I had no car so  a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth in and also to meet at away locations I think it probably would have been worth it to  do whatever it took to get a car at that time  so  well I'm Ivan tell them very patient and also I have some original original artistic ideas so  those are those are good qualities I'm very loyal and and also  and I support my friends fairly generous with them so  it's a  I said I really enjoyed it was I had a  I had a nice experience. Just photographing out a soccer game recently  that really enjoyed that so  okay  it's my pleasure thank you goodbye  I'll head to bed  let's write interesting,10

361,yes I'm doing great how about you  I'm born in the US I was born in Orlando Florida  my parents my dad had a lot of friends in Los Angeles so decide to move here  he was pretty different I mean the place I was before was very it was a very small town we probably won't even notice it on the map so it was a big learning experience on cuz we know the schools were a lot larger in different cultures and ethnicities so it was a unique experience  last time I've been back was probably about 5 years ago  definitely different my aunt she lives in again and she lives in a small town I'm so if you want to go to a movie theater you have to drive out at least an hour or if you want to go to a mall it's it's an hour drive so I'm the complete opposite of Los Angeles  convenience everything everything I could possibly want is here the weather is great shopping mall have a lot of friends here Sports place just kind of like the perfect area you know you don't want to live here kind of for the rest of my life actually  the big thing would probably be traffic I mean wherever you go there's going to be traffic with it on the 405 for the 101 it's it's just traffic you know I can kill like 2 hours in your day which is huge  quite a bit for a personal info for Business site travel you know he usually overseas or domestically my trouble so and I enjoyed a lot  I'm singing different places different areas meeting new people eating different kinds of food being able to sightsee and tour if I have a day or two free I'll miss just experiencing now I'm having new experiences just in riches my life  I'm computers  and I also did English as well  yes I am  I'm at work an it and it department at a Semiconductor Company  probably working for Apple since I pretty much when everything they have be great to work for Apple  I'll get it depends there are times when it's good to be alone but for the most part I consider myself an outgoing social person  nothing too much I guess if you kind of make a promising you and you break it several times and I might get a little bit make it a little bit annoyed but I don't think I would get really mad  all the questions I probably say I tend to eat a little bit more  just kind of keep my mind off of a little bit but usually doesn't last that long so it's a product I 10 that you. A little bit more more kind of like maybe junk food or something  I think I'm pretty good I rarely get mad and if I do it doesn't really last that long so I think I'm pretty good at controlling my temper again I really don't get angry so it's not really an issue for me  I said during the elections were talking about President Obama and Mitt Romney and you know who'd be the best fit for the next presidency  that kind of got a little bit I guess a little bit heated but it was more for I guess more fun six and anything else but it was an interesting conversation  I like to eat out a lot watch movies play video games  disco out shop play sports watch the Laker game if I can if person would be probably the best bowling photography like doing a lot I like to do a lot of different things and of course like Tronics  the outgoing loyal intelligent funny and a great listener  no I have not  no  for most nights it's it's pretty easy just have to avoid drinking coffee or tea before I sleep more than that it's pretty easy  what's a little bit sluggish tired kind of reaction times a little bit slower aside from that nothing nothing too much like two glaring or anything the usual just being sluggish and not moving as quickly as I should  I'm pretty good have no complaints  pretty much the same  I guess today I had my car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything so that's great and I thought it was going to cost me you know something extra on the side but you know the the service advisor waved it so I got everything free today so I actually have a really good mood  nothing  probably don't spend as much save more money aside from that nothing else just be kind of more wise with your money  I'm replacing my best friend  he's kind of a you know help me out and I help them out as well so it's been kind of a great learning experience. Developing our our friendship and he's bailed me out a couple of times I feel them out as well so it's kind of mutual thing we do you know what each other and it's a great way to bond as well  I say probably going back back to Korea to visit my relatives you know they are a lot more different than I remember 15 years ago when I was a kid I was actually kind of afraid of some of them but now that I see them you know recently they've actually mellowed a lot and they're actually pretty fun to talk to you so it was kind of a learning experience for me because they're you know do they complete 180 from when I was at when I was a kid  I'm sorry poem  guesswork would be part of it  buying my the car that I wanted to a couple years to save up to buy the car but I I paid it all off so I don't have any more car payment so that's great too and you know being able to help my family all this wall  let's see a couple weeks ago I went to Las Vegas for the 4 CS which is great if you fancy gadgets electronic song you get to see all the other goodies coming out this year so that was pretty interesting to see and some things that you know when you read on blogs they didn't talk about so you get to see it actually in-person kind of experience it from a user standpoint so I thought it was great and it's just fun is Conecuh being a kid in the candy store you get to play with different gadgets so it's really fun for me,0
362,his word  thank you  are you okay  yes  good  from California  I like the Arts and entertainment I like the you have a lot of freedom to work in a lot of different fields I like the fact that the weather is great by the fact it on my roots are here all my family is here  I don't like  how hard it is to get places anymore it's very hard this so much traffic it takes a long time to get where you're going it's expensive it's a lot more expensive than it used to be  not anymore  I study journalism English music and special effects makeup  are you still  I am  now I am managing a doggy day care facility  my dream job is to  own my own company again probably working with animals  no  I'm I'm an artist I draw a paint I do tattoos I work a lot with animals I like outdoor activities biking hiking  people that aren't Fair people that are  angry and the people that are dishonest  you see I will give myself a 10 second timeout and think about it before I speak or react  I'm very good at controlling my temper  I'm very close to my children and my father  I have two boys I have a older boys 22 is name is Alexander I was younger son whose 20 his name is Jonathan I'm very proud of them  no it's never easy it's the hardest job in the world but it's the best  just wanting to prevent your children from making the mistakes you've had but you realize that they have to do that it just to learn how to live life and that's one of the hardest things is letting them make their own mistakes  the unconditional love my boys have for me the  everything that being a parent has made me a better person it's made me a better everything a better employee  I think being having my children made me  much better person everyday  probably I have a lot I've had a very full life I would be really hard to say to narrow that down I've had so many  how do your best friend in Spanish  I'm a good friend I'm a true friend I'm honest and real I'm dependable and I don't play games and no drama  no  yes I have  and  February 2011  I was attacked by a stalker and almost killed in November of 2009 he broke into my apartment and laid in wait for me and attacked me when I came in the door and tried to kill me  I do  I think therapy has helped me tremendously I don't think I'd be able to hold a job and be responsible and be  a productive member of society without therapy  I'm able to handle things better I don't get so emotionally upset a lot more rational I try to see more rational than emotional more rational and logical  so so I've been sick and I've been run down all stressed out  I have yes I have  I use the restore on the resources that I've learned and I reach out to other people I try not to isolate I try to  use the tools that have been given to me in therapy I don't use medication anymore so it's mainly just proactive treatment or I have to do something about it  it's not it's never easy it's always bad  tired lethargic it's hard to keep my thoughts in order it's hard just to do the basics during the day  I need to buy something  no  I can't remember  oh I went to the beach with my oldest son and his best friend and we rode three-wheel three-wheel bikes and that was a lot of fun  what are you most proud of in your life  it's hard to say right now I haven't decided I'm very proud of my children I would say that's probably at they're really good boys  I have too many regrets right now  to finish school to stay focused to not  let myself get distracted  to focus more on long-term goals and short-term goals  my father  I'm very honest I'm very calm I don't get angry easily it takes a lot to provoke me I'm a reliable if I say I'm going to do something I do it  and I'm a I'm not basically what-you-see-is-what-you-get I don't I don't pull any punches with people  anything to do with animals I love animals I always smile around animals any kind big small I like older people elderly people I like to help them and be around them I like children  all finished  I've never done that,20
363,okay great so everything's all set up now okay  okay  sorry about that.  want to give me one second I'll be right back okay  that's okay  user  we have this  yeah course  so that's all right so just keep going so I'm going to  something for our purposes after I start  kind of spooky  okay  hi I'm Ali  created to talk to people in the states  and please  are you okay with this yes  good how are you  I am from Los Angeles  yes  it's the center of everything that you can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far I like being in the city  well meaning la also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great but you know you live with that  why was a business administration major so I studied business and after I finish college I am pursued a career in retail operations  are you still doing that I know as a matter of fact I am not a kind of changed career over the last four or five years so I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business  a couple of factors after working a new Mercy years in the retail business I switched over and worked in a creative business which is a graphic design firm and I captured her now a lot of knowledge in the in the Human Resources side because I was the operations manager / benefits manager for a small company  are you happy  yes I'm very happy I did that I picked up a lot of knowledge and and is very helpful  I love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me  well my dream job is  I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am a independent contractor I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs and I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I needed to do the things I want and obviously I worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place so I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle but also I have I also enjoy what I do I'm not under as much stress as I used to be  I'm not well I'm not totally outgoing but I'm not I'm not extremely shy I'm probably right in the middle may be more towards outgoing but I'm not totally out going I mean when I'm around other people I am in a social situation that I guess you could consider me right now going person but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself  can you tell me about  oh sure you know I have  couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had had bypass operation and it had it had to do with stress and things like that I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me if I meet someone new I don't just openly say well you know I've experienced this this and this so I just basically if it comes up I won't deny it or if it comes up and it's a if it I feel like it's something to talk about I will talk about it  sometimes when I'm feeling 10  hey I know it's not Hawaii  actually my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom my mother and she's a senior citizen and she's alone so what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very therapeutic  I'm not thumb  shortfuse kind of person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as my temper is concerned there's not there's not much to that  I'm trying to think here I can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with and I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago and they weren't very understanding of the situation and I I I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was I was more than willing to take care of my issues but they were playing Hardball and I didn't care for that  it does  probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was  it had to do with a life-and-death situation with my my stepfather who is battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him or there's a slight chance of going to help him even though he's pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but you know I felt like if I didn't try and see if we could save his will help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and then take that extra step that I would regret it in the long run  it is I was  well right now I'm separated from my wife so she has her issues I have my issues but we are not divorced we are just separated and we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together  and the relationship with my mother is really great you know she's very understanding I'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late and she's in a later stage of her life she's 82 years old and and so she needs to I guess it's good that end in its own way maybe fate is taking place because you know someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there I think she should do the Comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child  something you feel guilty about  probably the most guilty I feel about anything you are the things that I did to hurt my marriage as far as  the things that I did the selfishness that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife  yeah I am  got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress my wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had and that we were growing apart and when she was away my form of release was to go to the casinos and Gamble and so you know I spent a lot of time in the casinos and what eventually happened was I spend a lot of money and always see that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do a trust because I'm  and it was devastating to my wife  I felt what weight when it came to light I felt very guilty and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life  no not at all  diagnosed with depression no not really no  how easy is it for  I don't have problems sleeping that's why I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping so no  no not at all  no I will I just don't think I could say is  after I had my heart attack a few years ago I don't let I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so I tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that  tell me about the last time you saw  the last time I felt really happy  probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and he basically said to me that after many tasks and many months of Rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no Scar Tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watch my diet and took my medications  what are some things you wish you could change about  well I guess number one thing is  my physical being itself I like to be a little bit more healthy or lose some more weight just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally just not go back to the old ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish  just one day at a time you know I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis I meditate I read you know I read some books I watch TV I do things that I know that if I can I get if I can help myself I do things to help myself  there's a lot that I regret obviously in my marriage my working career as far as I had a long career with this Majors food chain in and I basically because of my gambling issues I ended up ruining a very good career but  at this point right now there's not much I can do I can't change what's been done so I don't Focus too much on the past I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me everyday  what advice wake up and and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes you need to be changed you know you know I'm not a  I'm not someone that's not intelligent but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and  yet what you doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately  probably  the proud what I'm proud about overalls the fact that I did all these awful things but deep down I don't think as a person I'm a bad person I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling in compulsive Behavior it was because I had an illness of compulsive obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and that I was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night  one day at a time  it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you and I could be okay for other people to do certain things but I cannot do those things anymore  how do your best friend describe  what's my best friends can describe me as probably easygoing generous a nice person to be around and  you know  they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the and the breakup breakup of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know  well my ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around 6 I go to a local park and it's about this park is probably lay down where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that I am  can I go home work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just kind of kick back for the rest of the day and then the next day I I do the same thing again in the morning I have to go for a walk work out in the yard watch TV whatever just relax that's how we can goes for me  thank you  bye  lock yourself out  okay  kind of like I actually got comfortable talking to,0
364,therapy like this instead of fun  with a live Human to put all the NFL teams out of business  because Provost  I don't think it's good sometimes I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to  if it's someone that might just go buy a couple questions might judge you or for opinions of it's a virtual human being in might be a little less biased also  and nothing's great idea  we could sit at home and do this instead of a going into an office  now she is  that she can have it  thank you very much  how do I know what does she going to say the end of session or okay  I'm a sheep but also I'm going to actually have to go grab a tissue  oh I'm sorry  not at all  sorry about that  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  I'm not a therapist  are you okay with this p.m.  I feel pretty good I'm wide awake I had any good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and I have an easy day today so I am just going to chat with you then I'm going to the gym and run some errands so I plan on having a nice day today  originally  I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here and I went to school away and but I'm one of the few days that are actually in Los Angeles  yes I am  I like the weather having a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida I love the weather here I like the cultural diversity I like the familiarity I like that beaches Basswood like the chest an hour and a half away one can go to the desert Palm Springs Palm Desert but also another hour and a half two hours away and go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and I think it's a great place to live  well maybe some of the things I don't like that I like your say California in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to 13 points something out which is going to Chase business out of here also the regulations I'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have been their businesses to taxes Arizona Nevada excetera some the other western states that are less regulated and that's a good problem here and California  it really does muscle don't understand it but it's also  yeah besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what make our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of  so that's how you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with do you want that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high in people are moving out of state  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I enjoy traveling got into 66 countries  and I don't travel as much as I used to but I've traveled quite a bit and I just learned a couple of languages and I surf I'm sorry  I didn't really understand that your question  when you said like what I don't think you understood what I said but I'll just go back and  I've been all through Europe Eastern Europe Asia South America North Africa and I enjoy that and I enjoy the warm climates now especially where you can go and relax where is warm water to surf the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and I also like to exercise Surf and do yoga and workout and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life  I love to hear  what are my favorite trips of all time where they used to when I was younger see how many countries I can do in a relatively short. Of time saying it three or four weeks span but about 10 years ago we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though I've been there about 10 times we got to know the city really well which was great really live like a local and rent a small flat cooked and did our own shopping but really haven't been there so many times it really never stayed for more than 3 or 4 days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and I really get to learn the city and it was fun even though I grew up in La I grew up taking French which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I when I was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take French in the Spanish would have been a lot more valuable but I took French all through elementary junior high  Tienda high school so it's nice to practice my French even though I don't remember a whole lot and even though it's Dad speaking French with the French you know my accent isn't the greatest ever a couple of sentences they start talking English to me  so that was out  I have a few different degrees  so I was a naval science major as an undergraduate  and that was fun and I also have a master's degree in economics  and I've degree in crisis management  I found them interesting and  just something that I wanted to do where I went to college I went to the Naval Academy I'm up there to play sports and I found it real interesting being from Southern California going to school on Maryland and I originally want to be a doctor but  which start going to school for a little bit you change your mind excetera so  are you still working  I'm actually in the wholesale business now or Wholesale Distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but I went to work there a number of years ago when am I grandfathered recently father passed away so I was going to run up a tirol family business and it's pretty interesting I like it having grown up around it but different other jobs out of the past  actually probably my dream job I enjoy cooking and staying at home and  I would probably like to stay home and raise kids because I do have one daughter and you didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked but I think I would be better than say a lot of women I know that want to work I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids you know that I like doing it always on a part-time basis but it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and not do that having pretty much worked for most of my life so I'll probably never happen but it sounds something that to me it would be fun  do you consider yourself more shy  I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable I think I'm more of an extrovert More Strangers might think I'm more introverted but I think when I feel comfortable with certain people and I don't know what it is I can meet a stranger and be totally confident or people I might have known for years either from a personal or business situation  and be more introverted I just go with the Dynamics but I think my outward manifestations to be a little more shy generally and he's like use the term reserved  okay  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  oh wow that's a great idea I used to have that on one of my guy with several computers at home and I bet you speak one of my screen savers as well when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events exercise will there be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or Tony the beach yeah maybe going surfing of the weather is warm I don't start from cold weather anymore cuz it makes  because Mike a brain freeze you not surf you know if over 30 years and exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find relaxing  I like that screensaver I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home  that was that was it but it's one of the things that took me a number of years to master that were my relaxation skills apart and have them the best of my twenties but over the years I think I've gotten better  I think that's a key thing I think as we mature as we learn how to do that I wish I don't have to do that and be a little more hadn't had those skills earlier  I like to think I'm pretty good I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged you know I I am more likely to think before I speak now whereas a 20 years ago is more likely act before I thought so my dad said more things that I would ever attend situation where their personal or a work situation but I've never had a violent temper but I would have a temper where fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it I think I'm a lot better at that now that I was saying my teens or twenties  I think a lot of that comes out here or there is maturity  oh wow you know I really had an argument with anybody in Somali what I would consider it traditional  argument probably my ex-wife a number of years ago. We had an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we weren't married our values are so different just our ideas of parenting and just  outlook on life was so different nothing that cost us the butt heads but it's just I know if I caught an argument but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree but heads some  I felt like I was talking to a wall and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone else folder with them that's the kind of discussions that people usually have but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes or younger work looking at boy how does that I look great on paper to her and she look great on paper to me I'm pretty easy-going I have different ideas on raising children have she did and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right not that I was right she was wrong it's just how we raise our different views and we never really  discuss those things but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads weren't really a good match whereas other things look good on paper to both of us  tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differ  find recently my father passed away recently  thank you and  really because in our religion you plan a funeral very quickly United typically within a couple of days and I really only invited very very close friends and family members has more or less sort of in charge of it my dad is were married but it was sort of not really up to it so I took care of it and I wish I had invited a  I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it so I really know he invited because just before the time pressure really just a handful of people but now it's times past I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you have 10 or 20 points is of people he knew you from business or over the years and I really just an even distant family members I really just told after the fact I really didn't invite him this I was under a time pressure but I could have easily have done it via email or turn to call everybody personally but I wish that some things people have expressed a little  they're upset with me one my other family members through it all back at me all you can tell me till after the fact that you know someone serve it passed so they all through the media so I was more or less  doing this I wish I did that differently but I did the best I could at the time so I'm not really mad at myself that's something I probably should have been more prepared for all service it was something that was coming was inevitable so  my boss my parents are recently  deceased in the last couple of years and had a brother that I've three are brothers one of who passed away in December  and we're not super close like I always like I look at other families we were just never liked that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but I wish it was more like boy one of those families I got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all also a different  I understand. That's just how it is but you know the strangers most of us how to use family everybody's great you know but I think every family has their own sort of  nope I thought probably I could have had it before from  some other events in my life and I just wasn't sure I've had been to some therapy in the past just from  you know I was in the military and I was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but I think I function  pretty well but I just wasn't sure that I had been nesin therapy and counseling over the years  I should decide to enlist in the military didn't enlist as an officer  I want one of the service academies  17 I started after high school and went to a service Academy  so it's more Prestige this isn't enlisting it's the hardware I want to sell her to school in America to get into  I was but same age as everybody else and went there  did you ever see KO  we did  1983  just basically wasn't anything intense was just weird just around since we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our positions were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us  so that was a I was at wasn't anything too too intense with lot you know he just fits the service I was in the training is way more intense in any actual combat situation  that's because they train you will like you practice harder than you play ignorant ass like he play football practice harder than you actually playing the game the same with  you know if you're in a combat unit  all right baby more patriotic having grown up  in California where people were from all over the country and I got to meet us most of see my friends who grew up in an affluent Los Angeles like I did never really went out and met a lot of American some people from different backgrounds and ended up becoming  just more patriotic a deeper sense of pride in the country what is really don't grow for that in Southern California where someone in Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia North Dakota South Dakota Montana  it was up with that kind of Pride so I thought it was getting and unlike somebody my friends that they don't know what he's there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan  I went to graduate I was still in the reserves but I went to graduate school  and I got to graduate degrees and I'm at work in private Enterprise didn't care for it that I join the fire department As A Firefighter and paramedic for a number of years and  then after I got divorced it was hard to do the custody situation with my daughter so into work in the family business that's pretty much my career in a nutshell  at first it was difficult because I just had such a bearing in my butt from the way I walked I talked and I guess I was an officer you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder to be a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles  I guess I was just so so different I think I handled better than most I have a stronger personality  so but it's a great experience  it all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life I generally sleep pretty well  even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now but I generally sleep do I sleep pretty well  I feel pretty good lately you know I've been like anybody else more periods of blowing your life but the last few months I feel great pretty much  no not really I seem like I seem a little happier and more content lately  okay  have you been diagnosed with depression I thought maybe in the past said you have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real to debilitating and I wasn't able to really function on my own but I was concerned with it and sought counseling  I do I was really against in the past and until after I went and then I wish I went more save during my  my marriage or the course of my life now I think it's very useful however in the past I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money excetera but I think it's a useful tool that you're open to it  it's just a question. I want to just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional even though I wouldn't see somebody like you and realize I'd prefer some of his older than I am a little more life experience and some of his may be younger  so but yeah I think it's a useful tool and I really did a 180 switch on that  I don't know now I'm started taking a break from it but I'm not against it if I have some issues I want to bounce off I give someone that I can go to  I think it's nice you know they really if you got to someone who's good and it could have been that few different people at start a therapist shot they really don't tell you what to think which I think it's great you know that's the passage to help you talk through your your thoughts  and you're feeling to let you decide yourself but bring a little Clarity to the situation that's why I like  talking to someone with a lot more life experience  and I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff to take to a man  so but it's  I think it's a useful tool I got some good ideas and was able to slice bouncing some things off totally some of these unbiased is not in your day-to-day life instead of talking to a romantic partner or close friends whenever you but sometimes bouncing the people off of stranger is good  last time you felt really high  all this morning I know this this is weird them clearly someone and I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and Associates it clearly haven't having an easy day today cuz I knew we had a nice weather and I have much of errands to run and I clearly have seasonal affective disorder but I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and called where I always I know that time so but I'm just what I woke up really happy today but then it's going to be a nice day  I look forward to feeling the Sun so  most of my friends I'm sort of a renaissance man I know a little bit about a lot of subjects I'm too smart for my own good  and I'm off  I know a lot a lot a lot a lot of pretty things I'm pretty rational I'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and I'll talk them through it or resource won't tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy new car or  you know I'm great with medical diagnosis  and people say I'm a lot of fun and fun to be with and  I also have I don't have a lot of Grey areas people either really like me or don't like me to meet the things are pretty much black and white  I am what I am I don't BS  yeah I'm the opposite of a politician  I don't tell people what they want to hear to be rude not read anybody but call things as I see him that's pretty much  really said you everything tactfully  okay I like to think I do  I wish Ice Bobby spent more time with my parents before they passed but it's busy I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was young  but just one of the three typical  really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now  I think that's that's it and it would look at things in the long-term instead of looking and things in the short-term you make decisions or choices  what are you most proud of in your life  I'm proud of my daughter she's nice young lady I am proud of my public service I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service there very few people like me who did it or is that the background and education that I did but I like public service  and some proud of all that I'm proud of all the certificates I have hanging on my walls and how many degrees it's sort of like trophies I'm proud that they be able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and  knock would maintain good health  it was nice meeting you  bye-bye thank you  how was I  what does old-fashioned you know like Mom,0
365,so she's going to chat with you for a bit I'm actually before I do that okay okay  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in it safe  I'm not a thing  are you okay  sure  I'm doing alright  New Jersey  yes  3 months ago  not very often  how does it compare to LA  that's much different  I don't know it's just it's a lot more crowded here  to start a new life for myself  it wasn't very easy at all  it was quite rough at first but you know I'm still trying to get used to a life here  I've got some good friends here and I love the Hollywood area  I just did all of the mountains are beautiful kind of things I love  things you don't really  the traffic  not really know I don't  just haven't had the time or the finances to  okay  what you study  digital media  how did Judas  well life always love you know computers and you know designing things and I know it's kind of fell into it  are you still doing that no  I dropped off  well I guess my dream job would be working in something that I went to school for a night and never really completed my education  but I guess it'd be great if I want you know back to school and you know it finished you know my degree in digital media and you know if finished started working you not doing something in that field  a little bit of both. I can be shy at times but  I like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a struggle for me but  I don't want to be you know in a shell so I can force myself to be outgoing  listen to music sometimes just drive and you know play music in my car and that helps me relax  or smoke a cigarette  like what  Stucky middle that's all I listen to is metal  awesome  well it depends on  how high my stress level is and how angry I am  but I I do my best to not get so pissed off  when was the last time you are  and  I don't know if she  she wanted me to come and pick her up  she's a little drunk  and we just kind of fought over the phone over some other things and  I just ended up not picking her up  because of her attitude on the phone with me  yeah it does  something I feel guilty about not talking to my kids often  or as often as I should  I've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that I I don't really have time to  you know talk to my kids as much as I'd like to  you have no idea  it's it comes natural but it's snowy easy and it's it's the hardest job that I love to do  but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and I made the choice to come out here to LA  and I feel bad that I don't see them you know  but  the reason I came out here was to better myself so I can provide for them  what's the hardest thing about being  fear you know  just fear what we need another if you're what's going to happen to your kids who fear  that something awful is going to happen  and not seeing them brings about that fear a lot more you know and I can't I can't always be there with them I can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when I was living in Florida  and I at least needs to see them it wasn't very often but I still used to see them now I don't see them at all and that's the that's the hardest thing I've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily cuz I don't know how long we'll be here for  I don't know what my future holds  but the hardest thing is being so far away from them  I'm sorry  the best thing about being a parent  the joy that they bring to me I mean I could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up  I mean  it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's  it's the worst thing ever you know but  I love to just see their faces if they just bring a smile to my face and  well  I think the fact that I can get down to their level goofy or as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you no strict all the time she refused to let you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kind of held back like a lot of emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy but with me I'm very goofy and silly like it that I'm strict when I have to be  but I always love to be no playing around with them as much as possible you know not I don't want them to grow up too fast  but that may have been  well  situation that I wished I would have handled differently  there's so many  I guess what I was still with my ex-wife  in Florida I wish you wouldn't have gotten so angry or I wish I wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions  she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and now you know keep picking at me until I exploded and I allowed her to do that  you know it I should have just walked away when I could  you know now that my temper get the best of me  no  no  no  how is your day  sometimes it's hard  sometimes I just lay awake in bed you know thinking all the things are going through my head all the you know all the stress that I'm going through with work and Nino  making sure  I wonder if I'm going to I'm going to be able to make you know rent you know one day when my kids are going through you know when I'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father  you know those are some things that went through my head and  and it keeps me up at night sometimes  a little but you know I put myself in the situation so  you know I got up  bear with it and I got to  I know that you reap what you sow so lights  I got to deal with it in my own way  have you noticed any changes in your butt  lately I've been trying to not think so much about  you know all that's going on in my life  I try to distract myself  the kind of  gets me in a better mood you know if I'm hang out with my friends or just watch a little TV something to get my mind off you know all the stresses of my life  the last time I felt really happy  was I see a couple of nights ago I went out drinking with them  with a couple of my friends from work and  I don't know we just got pretty drunk and that kind of help me to forget all the crap that was previously gone through my head  so if I can distract myself I can forget about all that other stuff  but I'm happy  some of my best qualities I guess I'm convincing kind of like a I guess you would say a counselor to some people only answer my close friends I made talk people into doing things that they may regret or I'm at I'm going to try to talk people out of things that they and I may end up regretting or I may  you know just listen to people so you know I can see that you know I definitely know with my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like what I'm going through  lips in Florida  you know I talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and  you know I just kind of  talking about his problems to listen to I merely listen because you know I don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when I was living in Florida I was very close with him so you know you can always rely on me and now that I'm here in LA  I don't want to lose that you no connection with him because I mean I've always been there for himself  he him your lies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice in about what I think you know he should do  I think he appreciates that night and I'm glad that he you never lies on me for that I that he trust me enough to tell me all that stuff  upgrade  what are some things you wish you could change about your  LOL  sometimes I wish I wasn't so kind or just rest  it seems bad but sometimes I don't people may take advantage of me and I may not realize it  and I don't like saying no to people I like  to always please people  so if I can change them I wish I wasn't such a people pleaser  and that gotten you in trouble  sometimes financially in trouble  sometimes I get annoyed  help others in that you know  that made me broke sometimes I may not have enough to  pay bills but I feel better helping people I don't know  I regret  nut  breaking up with my ex-wife sooner  Arie Arie  because she put me through so much crap in my life  and I'm  I was wishing to be a people pleaser ocean to please her you know China  please my kids as much as I can but not breaking up you know the family  but  there's only so much one person can take  and I think probably if I would have left sooner  I'm even happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know  during all those years with her  so if I would have got out sooner  I don't know my whip been happier by guess  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  it's okay to be selfish  it's okay to you know  think about yourself sometimes  you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you  then you're not thinking about yourself you're nothing about what makes you happy  even though pleasing people make you happy  you have to think about yourself sometimes too in about your needs  because you know  you play an important role  in the lives of your close family members  and in order to keep everything afloat  you sometimes get up you got to worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up witches yourself so  be a little selfish sometimes it's okay  right  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  I don't even know what weekend is anymore  my ideal weekend would be  locked away alone in my room  watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not going to be with anybody or could be out at a bar  you know you know watching a metal show  so I like to be alone  but at times I I do want to be out with that with others I like you know being around people  crazy  he thinks I'm a I'm crazy for coming out here  but I guess you would say that I'm dedicated and then I'm strong-minded  and that you know whatever I set my mind so I can do it you know no matter how hard it is I'm not going to wimp out  so every night I really respect him for giving me his insight  but I guess yeah I guess you'd say that  crazy butt  show my dick  my kids  yeah that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know her like real real Joy are my kids and  you know just having on my life is promised me I could never help us just having thumb  in my life  and although I don't get to see them as much  you want to think about those thinking about you know  how far they've gone  you know what what they've accomplished in their you know  in the short time we did it yeah it makes me happy and I can't wait to see them again  one of my most memorable experiences  I guess that would be  Florida  you know you want to Ciara and I fear band Skeletonwitch  it was it was a great night overall you know what was that I thought never forget it's because we've been looking forward to it for you know somebody months and you know what it finally happened Alyssa real  it was a great night after all and overall  sure you're welcome  take that off,12
366,"so she's going to chat with you going to bring that doorbell back over here sounds good  hi I'm Ali  creative  I'm not a  you  and please feel free to tell me  are you okay with  okay  I'm great and you  a Los Angeles California  I like the diversity I feel La by itself is a country there's so much to do so much to explore and there's nothing like it  traffic I would say traffic and it real estate prices are kind of crazy compared to the rest of the country  I have traveled I have traveled a bit I like to travel more though so I've been to a few countries  like what I've been to most of Europe at the continent I've been to London I was born here but my family from Nigeria so I've been to Nigeria a few times I've been to Denmark Amsterdam I've been to World sci-fi. Germany and I think that's it that's it yeah that's it  what do you enjoy about  just exploring exploring new places sing new things meeting new people a different culture it's definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it and also going to countries that may not be as adult as the USA definitely definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know what this country  okay well let's see London I accidentally actually when I first heard about going to London I really didn't care for it cuz I know much about it the only thing I remember is watching Mary Poppins and but when I went there I absolutely fell in love with it just  if I have the hustle and bustle of LA but at the same time you can go to very very slow pace we didn't do any driving we just went on the tube which is there are like the underground subway station which I absolutely fell in love with and just exploring different parts of the city we went to you know Big Ben Westminster Abbey they actually had when I went there the other premiere of the movie with us Slumdog Millionaire and also they had to Premier for seven seven pounds is a movie with Will Smith they did so Will Smith was over there and we were you know me and my friends are like I like screaming like we were like groupies just so you know just so you know your antics but yeah  yeah  business management and an option in Human Resources management what that means I have no idea  the question I've always avoids want to go into business and I've always want to study Finance but I didn't think I would learn too much about Finance from  College purse I think I've learned more in the real world whatnot so that option was human resource in the morning fasting about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so I went for that  well I still I still kind of use what I've learned but I I work in Property Management so  anything to do with people I'm fascinated about so yeah  I love my job  say it's virtually made for me  how to get one my dream job wow  I would say being a life coach  I'll tell ya I would say about my dream job because I love helping people become successes and I helped I love being a part of someone else's success even the regardless of how small it is I'm will it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation I like I just like helping people have a better life so I think you know idea for Friday for free like all day yeah  more outgoing definitely more outgoing I'm usually the life well it's weird cuz I'm usually considered like the life of the party I'm the one who is cracking jokes and making everybody laugh at the same time I can be very very quiet and to myself so  I turn on the fish tank screensaver I know it's not Hawaii  what do you do  to relax I usually listen to music  Asia listen to music to relax me or I pray  try to relax myself or listen to some really calm music so yeah  very good very very good I used to I want to say was a bad temper but I was known to  go off quot and quot not throwing chairs anything like that but  I'm a very patient person  once that patient is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it's done I I just go off  no no  the last time I argue with someone while having argue with me long time  boy  I argued with my  no I would see my I think my dad I argued with them about  we were disagreeing on some things about when we're going to supposed to go back to Nigeria  and he wasn't listening to it was kind of a group discussion myself in my my siblings and he was being very subjective he wasn't being open to other people suggest engine suggestions and concerns  so it started an argument  very  I would say angry per se but I felt very  come like I was losing control  like a mom to type while I like to be in control of my emotions in my thoughts and I feel  once that patience is gone and I start going to off it's kind of like this  yeah I'm called a blur but I'm very witty and quick with what I say so I'll instantly say something that you know  how to say hurtful but I'm very direct and to-the-point make sure I get my point across  I have three brothers one one younger to older I am very close to my family and my mom's are my best friends  my brothers are great love them to death my father and he's more thought of it picture  what's something you feel guilty about  I don't I don't really I'm not the guilty pipe I don't feel guilty I'm not one to shy away from what I've done and I definitely own up to add you I'm not one to shy away from responsibility I don't think I ever feel guilty  Frank thing I do  yeah I don't think I feel good I usually don't feel guilty  pretty easy pretty easy at yeah I'm pretty good at falling asleep except when I'm excited while I'm reading from check when I'm going to focus on learning something like I'll read and read and read it when it's past my bedtime but now I'm going to work on  waking up much earlier than when I am now and it's kind of a little bit of a struggle but I'm getting to it so  I've been feeling I've been feeling fine you know I'm generally a very very happy disposition and sell  no yeah deep depressing moods nothing like that whenever if I feel do feel like I'm going I don't know allow myself to go to that place  have you been diagnosed with depression  thoughts  I would say  it's I want to say necessary changes by same or so behaviors learning how to  let go of past decisions may be that kind of how they they play their course in my life  I just said sometimes I kind of look back and say what if I did this what would have how would life be now now so that doesn't that's it  designing your  regrets no no there's anything I regret  Dennis 20 years ago  I would say don't be afraid of Who You Are  I'm be authentic more imprinting with yourself  erased from my memory  that's a good one  restore my memory  I would say what I say oh my tell my dad that he should act like a father  maybe I should yeah there was a  that was actually one of the times I am by the time I went off with him mom basically I had decided not to go to a private not to go away for college  I want I decided to stay local so I can look after my little brother  and my senior year I was overloading with everything I had maybe like for AP classes I was working if I was working three jobs at the time and was also on track and field so needless to say I was and I'm  I wasn't doing well in AP Calculus because I decide to go to a JC first and transfer also the save money for college to and when I told him you know the teacher called Sing us falling asleep in class because mind you after school I work an 8-hour shift cuz I was a retail manager at the time so I come home after that ship to do homework calculus let alone so he would get upset and I told him I spoke my accounts already told him that I don't need that class to go to the JC but that's okay I'm going to continue with some just going to I can't drop out at that point in time so I'm just going to let you know  yeah I'll discuss take the dfl whatever and he didn't he didn't like that cuz he is a teacher  and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanted to call my boss and it was it was just too much and I told him yeah sure my father should act like it but I was supposed more aggressive  one thing I do remember I do regret one thing  and that is I wish I continued with college throughout  like I I I burnt myself out I'm out spreading myself too thin nails actually I was actually on track to graduate from college at Wednesday 19 starting college classes in high school starting sophomore year in high school but with that that stuff enough stuff for Dad and working I just kind of like stop going to school for a while just worked if I went back to finish so but maybe that's one small thing but that's something small down  yeah  I'm very I'm a very compassionate and understanding person  I like learning new things I'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice I'm very objective I'll tell you the good the bad the ugly  and yes those are my best qualities  man found a way to have fun in any situation I can make light of any situation like I'm the kind of diapers I can break the tension in the room that sort of  that sort of a  personality trait  wish I was taller  beside my Heights  I wish  Maybe  I don't know if it's that be more I want say be more in touch with my emotions I think I would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes  I think that would be one thing because I'm the type of person wear  people say that they love me or care about me and I'm like okay great thank you I appreciate that I don't realize how much they do I think that's not realizing how much they care and love me that's one thing I would like to  get more of a grasp on  my best friend she described me as someone who's funny crazy objective boil  ambitious hard-working  mean why is Lake Joseph you're so mean  just I just I I I just like to I joke around all the time and so  we were right now at your planning a friend of mine or friend of ours a baby shower  I'm giving her some ideas and as another friend who is invited who we have some issues in the past and someone I don't talk to her hang out with we should be really close finally talks in person but don't mind them being there  so she also talked about having celebrating her birthday  also, like after the baby shower  and there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower we wouldn't do anything for and I'm like well we're celebrating this person's birthday might as well we should definitely you know on at this person's birthday as well since we're closer to the person is his birthday passed and I said you know what just when we celebrate everybody's birthday forget the baby shower just doing a birthday and said you're so mean but she was laughing about it  most proud of them in my life I would say being there for my family being bing them immensely any emotionally strong person family's gone through a lot of challenges and a lot of times I've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and everything makes everything make sure everything goes accordingly so I'd say more than anything make sure I'm there for my family  okay  thank you  bye have a good one  I took the top off",0
367,are there any parameters aren't I mean is should I just talk naturally or just went wherever I'm comfortable okay I get there  one last thing  let you know when she's done I'm going to hand you the  okay  and please  are you okay with this  yes  how are you doing  I'm okay I'm a little  pensive I guess a little down but more or less okay  I was born in Annapolis Maryland on the East Coast  originally I moved because I went to film school and but then I decided to come move back to Washington DC to do some work and now I'm back here again  it's very different being from the East Coast it just has a different feel to it but living  La is very as a very different kind of attitude I guess and so it's a little difficult but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here  not at all when I left things got things are sort of I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with  some people who are going to help me out and I'm just I don't know if it's strange just the right word but I'm kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off  it's not easy it's  it's kind of  I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there so it's difficult I mean it weighs on my mind a lot I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  depends on the situation I think I'm out going when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with this I tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but  I have certain  I do I do a lot of writing I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it's like it's when I feel most relaxed I guess  when is the last time that happened  a few weeks ago I guess I was I've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when I was really what I was really getting into writing it and  it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was accomplishing something and I was felt really relaxed  what was it about  it was about  guy who's searching for something it's  it's it's his last day on Earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just  I was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on Earth with her just because  certified it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing  what made you decide to do that  well I've always I've always been a writer part of the reason I came to La was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that I kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me  how hard is that  it's not easy the the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I when I love it I just absolutely love it but sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult but it's worth it for the times when it when it's good  how are you at controlling your temper  good I don't I don't really have a temper it's not I mean most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I've put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people  when was the last time you argue with someone  last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not  cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I'd already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I I ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  lot so much  I was in a relationship that I really really better really wanted to work and  I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I was on that I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended I mean I wasn't I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not  and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so  that was pretty that was pretty tough  you've done anything to avoid it  what some of it was was that  I wasn't medicated properly I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's  completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time so I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different if I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be  I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have  I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different  things being how they were  I mean it's  it's possible I mean obviously  yeah because I mean that's what I do I I  take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy I dwell on stuff and it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago I which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there  that sounds really hard  well it's not easy I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better  well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost  you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone if I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that  I just need I mean I I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet  I need triggered by something  they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that I said I see if I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know she will talk about  anyting you know I can reach back and connect to  to this it's really it's really  I don't know that's the thing I mean I don't ever get a break  from it  now  how easy is it for  I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and is I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't  I don't know I'd never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like I would I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep I don't clock out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now  it's just it's  yeah I don't sleep too great right now  pretty I mean I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm at I'm like how I am now I just I just feel bad  okay  how long ago were you diagnosed  I think  334 years ago  it was when I  I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4  years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so  so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so  at the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel  it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm  that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't  it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now  there really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either  I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off  but it was at least that and not  firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was  but it wasn't soon enough  not not as much as I should  I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I'm time you know what I'm getting my medication from the city of La so you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really  very I've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming  then there's you  right  changes have you noticed  well like I said I mean  this the top I mean let's just take the AAA for example because that's probably the close closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense  that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing  you know better than I that I have been I mean  it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life witches  Jazz at the juices don't own challenge  it was probably you know a couple of years ago  I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I ate that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree  and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just  feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger  the bigger life  that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel  you know for that instant I felt like  a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and  I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and  part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that  I don't know if I'll ever feel that again  so  what are you most proud of in your life  probably the  probably this educate educational series I did educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation  it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about  in about the world around them so that I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world  I was part of you know it's part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of  and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest  project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it  I guess  I don't know I don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile since I've since I've really thought about that I don't know what I'd go somewhere would I  I don't know  thank you  Audi,19
368,the shoes you know why did you do that a lot of things like that you right  I guess you're right  start it up for you  she can start chatting with you I'm going to put the doorbell back over here so when she's  hi  and please  are you okay with this  yeah I'm okay with it  I'm okay I'm okay I guess  I'm basically an l a kind of guy  things you really like about la  you know the weather it's usually pretty sunny and contemporary you know I like that the climate really a lot of the girls here you know I like let's see I don't like the traffic you know but I like the Hispanic population quite a bit you know  and I have a lot of friends here so I guess you know I don't want to be anywhere else  like I said the traffic you know I was on the phone with 500 that's always kind of in a crummy the cost of living that's really you know terrible but it's always expensive and you know I really don't like  I really don't like you know I can just seems like I'm always one of those places were like you know you have like a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you're down and you know that the ghettos you know  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I have I've been to a couple places you know book very brief in a Multiverse for school I want Arizona and New York in Montana anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that that's what I'm doing right now  I like getting away from the city you know I was in Yosemite last year in Ohio in the summer for vacation that was kind of nice you know your family was really really need to see but you're busy getting away from the city I guess you're not getting away from the job getting away from the stress here  I actually studied political science and I also studied economics I'm a big kind of political you know junkie you know that begin with for a natural Valentine with that kind of field of study  I was I was but I lost my job and you know that's kind of a bummer you know the last it's cheese it's only been maybe a year and a half an hour maybe two years and you know the condom got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know I wish I was working there again  I love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me  well I wanted to be a lawyer one time I want to be a lawyer in a and that's why I took political science and I took a double major in economics and the sad thing is the sad thing is that a you know what to get into law school to take the entrance exam called the Alsace and I study for a leg really hard core you know it for about a year and I took the test and like an idiot I didn't feel right about that that day it was kind of an off-day and you know it's like going to the big game of the Super Bowl by just don't I don't feel like I did well and I cancel the test and so on  do I kind of regret that you know  tell me about it  I'm not really shy at all I'm definitely not shy but outgoing and me not one of these people not flamboyant you know I'll talk to people I don't mind talking to people I don't mind meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like I'm you know Dinan to kind of meet anybody  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but  I guess  these days you know I play guitar and I taught myself how to play guitar thank you thank you I should actually be doing more of it but I also like to exercise I'm going to die right now but my dad's been terrible time eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great I love to X I love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is the ground and they pop workout I just wish that my eating habits where we're in line we're a little bit better you know  okay  my temper could be you know definitely improved a lot you know I'm in a lot of times I I feel I'm one of these introvert types person when it comes to let you know I don't mind being an extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever we know what I'm mad I really don't want to be you no talking to people I don't like to yell I don't have to scream but I'd like to hear I don't like to fight a kind of close down a lot I don't know what you want to be left alone sometimes I tend to drag it on for longer than it should be in the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe you know I just don't I just want to talk him I just don't want to deal with it it kind of close down and shut you know  shut off for a little bit  cheese doesn't happen too often  maybe with my wife you know it'll probably be something silly who knows  who knows  the thing is I don't have a lot of guilt I don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know I'm there are things that like you know call my nersons you know I get white lies or whatever you know what like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty  can you give me an example of a  let's see I guess sometimes you know you know I'm very guy but you know sometimes the times you know I like to smile a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know I don't know I never do anything about it never get the phone number you know but sometimes I like to like talk to people I guess you know  and that you wish you would handle different  well that's a good question I guess  I guess you know I always have to look the same but does not I don't ever wish to deliver to ever change it and never wanted to handle things differently I always kind of I'm pretty comfortable the way I handle things and you know I think that I could be a lot worse than like you no shouting and screaming and hitting in this and that and that's just not me you know I think the best thing to do you know it's kind of like get a lot of breathing room a lot of space and I don't wish for that to change or to handle any that differently I just don't really know what else to do you know and you know the last thing I want to do is start talking about you no feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing I want to do and so like I don't wish that I handle things like that differently in that way  tell me about your relationship with your family  well you know I'm pretty happy with my family right now you know if I'm married and we have a baby along the way which is kind of nice if some cats thank you thank you if cats and a dog a weenie dog and my mom I love my mom dearly she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control you know she doesn't control it and like it like FX4 health and nose has me worried about her and I stressing out about her and she could do so much too late for vented and she doesn't sand  you know I have a good relationship with my mom I love her dearly and actually have a good relationship with everybody I think I think I have a ton of family and friends get along with me pretty well actually you know  there are times I mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually I feel like you know I sleep like a baby the only problem I have I think is I feel like you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you just going to sleep and you can kind of like you know like you almost kind of looked for it is like I was falling sensation or something like that and it didn't happen that often but it happens and before the most time apart when I sleep like a really good  well right now generally I've been feeling worried and anxious and you know intense the reason why is because I see my mom right rallies today but found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and I'm kind of waiting to this is over so we can I can find out what's wrong with her but you know I'm worried about her she's she's at the doctor's right now so that doesn't tell me anything good and you know I'm trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so I feel like you know overwhelmed with a just a lot of like you know things to do in like and  and I'm a lot on my plate in like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but I have to handle it like you know so like I guess  well I keep myself distracted I keep myself busy I feel like a busybody you know the more you know it seems like it's not a good thing because I feel like I'm just adding more things on my plate so you know like one of things I do is like exercising so I have to workout everyday you know what that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know chicken change you need to start raining in Lagos to the whole thing of stretching and cooling down at 6 to take some time and then they can shower and all that kind of stuff to it takes time so it but I have to do a daily do I cope with it and that way I also cope with it to you know playing guitar but that's just more of a distraction you know what I mean keeping keeping busy that way it's just seems like it's not you know I'm working towards you know the goals you know that I need to do let you know if I find another job which I should be doing but then  in all it's one of those things were like I find that there's no good jobs I've been looking and looking like something that I do it it's just not what I want to do it just doesn't seem like I want to do is Lay terrible jobs  you know it's it's  probably harder than I'm thinking about it because sometimes I feel like you know one of these things is like  I feel like it is hard but it's not I mean they're always I can cope with it you know I just got out of a kind of accepted it a lot you know I can't internalize it and like you know it's not something that's like I'm out on the street or anything like that but you know it is a worry  I've never been diagnosed with PTSD I used to work with  no  tell me about the last time you felt  man  10 years ago the last time was really happy maybe  me nothing I feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know I learned a new song on the guitar I feel like not even happy about that you know I feel like I'm you know I work out something that kind of makes me happy no running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so I have these these These Times where I'm just you know feeling good about myself in a feeling you know but I'm never feeling great I'm never feeling happy and they were feeling like so sensationalize like you know and and and you know incredible that you know it's just another mile times where there's a few good times you know in a few bad times with a good times and never extremes you know never really good times and never really see no choices baddest X you know  well I wish this is Diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kind of hard you know cuz I'm the kind of guy who just likes who just likes you know you know why you like Mexican food makes you know I'm a snack and I don't know I just feel like that could I could change I wish I could change my eating habits that way I can let you know cuz I work out so much I feel like I do so much money and so much activity that like you know that if I got my tight and check you know that was also can change you know  my my I guess my my desire to like you know get a head like right now I feel just so like the kind of me so bad and like things are so unwell that you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kind of jobs like it just seems like I just wish I had a little more inspiration and motivation to like to  do things  the one thing I regret is is not is not you know it's this LSAT thing you know you know  not passing the test again with cuz I'm sure I could have got into it at school but then again later you know it has me thinking like do I really want to pay once you let you know Law School tuition and the cost of that and then you know just to just to be power down with more work and things like that I don't know it just didn't seem like like  there is this idea of justice and and and republicanism and you know things that I really ain't here to that I fall in love with a that I don't want to get away from but it's just seems like it's a ton of work and money and just too late for the smallest percentage of success it that you know you might not be able to do in that kind of feel you might and you know it just didn't seem like like it's worth overcoming the obstacles I need to overcome  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  I have no idea I would have 20 years ago I would tell myself maybe  and I think I've done everything really well for myself except for the outside thing you know which I regret on one hand on the other hand you know I'm not sure if I regret cuz what the bills and all that kind of stuff I told you about and I think you know I've waited to get married and waited to have a kid you know pretty cautious about this is why I don't take drugs I don't drink I don't fight I don't do any of these things that let you know that I think that real people have him in and they really like you to ruin their life you know it's like I'm pretty happy and content with being in or the cautious you know I don't know  okay  how do your best friend describe you all my best friend I think he kind of his likes me he wishes that I would do more things with him but he works at night and you know it's one of the things I think most people not just my best friend but my wife and remind me the rest of my family so that I don't put a lot of time and attention to them and they think that I'm pretty great when you give them the time of day and my attention but I don't know if I'm really there all the time you know I don't know if I'm really you know I'm always thinking about something else I don't know if I really can give him a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you don't usually do it you know but I almost feel like it's like a chore like you know Legacy you know if they really need me then I'll do it you know if it's just asking for a favor I almost felt you know I do have a lot of lackluster that I have hardness I just  it's not because I hate him I feel like I'm their friend makes them somehow you know like it makes me think you know the times I think I don't want them down the aisle my friends but it's the same time I just feel like it's it's more it's not it's not it's more like a chore to do instead of a  willingness like it oh my God like I just want to help you is that it's never like that it's just something that I do because I kind of have to do you know you got to go to do things for your friends you know in the end because of your friends you know and I do like them and they probably would do it for me and I know so I just do the things you know just  what are you most proud of in your life  well there are a couple of things that I do like that I could feel good about myself you and I ran the LA Marathon that kind of felt good you know I've graduated from college that kind of feels good do you know what I mean but the thing is I don't feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduated from college you know has it really made me successful you don't need me running the marathon hasn't made me sit there like half merits you know we're like the great in or may not have done it except Friday but you know they're going to make stepping stones It Like That I Used to Know life-long  benefit from

Just you know reading and I'm just having yourself relax then you know feeling good  yeah it is it is fun I love reading  I'm okay with it I'm not like the best you know the temper controlling person there is out there you know I tried my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually but I'm not like the best I mean I sometimes I do have my Outburst you know but you know I guess that's everyone I'm not sure if  haha that's a good question  I don't remember lipsi  honestly I can't recall Maybe  my goodness  I I don't know I'm very passive that. Just like let things go cuz I mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things you know so I don't know I'm not I I can't I honestly I can't tell you that  why don't we talk about that later I'm sure yeah probably come back to me  haha well I guess when I was younger I dunno could have been better older sister and I I wasn't and that makes me feel guilty for sure you know I could have been a better sister  better role model you know but I'm trying my best now so I'm trying to make things better  yeah  I guess huh  I don't know I mean I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life so if I erase something then it's just there's something of me and my present self or you know they would change and I don't know I'm pretty okay with the person that I am now I mean you know I don't think I would change an event you know I'm I'm okay with what you know about sand down and get them bad that has happened  yeah  I can't see your shoes but I don't travel a lot but I am kind of like an Explorer I guess I love to explore like even the smallest things like if I go hiking I go out Trail and you know just find my way up to the top you know somehow some way and just make it you know traveling I would love to do that but I don't know it just you know always circumstances in my life that doesn't you know always something you know I'm getting married children you know and all this so it's kind of like you know  it would be nice I guess you know it would be nice you know I love camping that's kind of like you know taking a few days trips out there camping you fishing yeah  since it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice was just me and him you know and it was like no one and it was like beautiful cuz it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful Lake and you know it was it was really nice it just yeah  hell  yeah yeah it was it was it was really fun it was like I would love to do it again you know right now it would be great and you know it just going out there it's just I love that Venture of things and the nature and just life and you know overall  it's it's easy but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because I don't know just you know just I'm laying there and I'm just like trying to go to sleep and I'm just a car but eventually I do you know I just I probably like me to position myself in a different side of the bed like sometimes I'm I'm in the headboard and I'm like I got to go to the other side once I position myself and I just like go to sleep you know but it just I got to find the the right position for me  yeah  I'm tired I get tired throughout the day you know but I kind of try to shake it off you know and just kind of like feel like it's a new day you know and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible you know and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night that they are so yeah yeah yeah it's just it's okay I try to make it the best I guess if not then I just go to sleep throughout the day which sucks but yeah  I know  no  everything good yeah I've been feeling really good you know a lot of things in my life have you know it. I'm having a really good year so far so I'm very happy with that you know everything's you know going good you know  yeah it is it is except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible but that's just nature  super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant you know I was really really happy about that and I was just like all you know that was really really good you know  very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and  who's it's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time I've never really liked it very happy  no  I guess just me myself you know like you know I could you know just be myself and that's it you know just I can't really you know say I have specific thing I guess I didn't mean it depends on the person that meets me to tell me I can't really tell myself like I'm this and that you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people. You know tell me or if you don't compliment me or whatnot yeah  nothing I think like I said I'm happy with the person I am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know I might have I don't know whatever flower people see in me and it's okay you know I'm okay with it whatever it's just I'm not going to change myself for the likings of other people I have only one body and one life so yeah  yeah that's it  just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you know it's you know how you learned from that you know from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe I should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role model so the world could just improve  just smile and be happy you know and whatever hard things happened you know you're going to get through it and eventually you know the only thing you can tell I don't know you can you no go back on his desk you know you could you know how hard break or whatever but you know song is I'm alive I still got to keep going  that's pretty most proud of I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be and that's pretty powerful you know you know I try to be you know  a better person each day and try to like you know I'm prove myself every day as much as I can you know that would probably be something I could be super proud of you know as much as I can very hard it is really hard you know cuz I can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know and you know it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but you know it's just it's it's sometimes you know how hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know that after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try you know  so yeah  you know loving friendly outgoing you know Adventures I guess I don't know that's what they say you know that's them like you know but that's what least what I try to be you know at least I try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible and I even sometimes even if I'm having a rough day I'm just like you know you know I just don't want to take it out on anyone or anything you know  yeah  my ideal weekend you should he I I like going to the park I like sitting down in like a tree under a tree at the other three where there's shade and just kind of put my blanket out there have my dog and like read a book and you sometimes if I don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise I guess cuz there's not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it just it's really neat  yeah  thank you you're welcome,0
370,"when she's done  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people and it's safe  and please  are you okay  yeah  I'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you  I'm from here in La I grew up in the San Fernando Valley  yeah  well I like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat I like the outdoor opportunities I grew up close to the hills so I did a lot of hiking and camping is pretty close by have gone snowboarding I like it the familiarity I think you know it's it's a big city and you know I'm pretty familiar with the having lived here for so long that I haven't said like that too  I'm probably the number one thing that everybody says I don't like Gothic that don't like being stuck in traffic I don't like  the long commute Stephen Nina for short distances  danonino gets really hot in the summer a time so you know that I could stand it being a little slightly cooler when I gets to its peak Peak heat but that's fine  well my dream job that's a great question I asked  I think my dream job would probably be you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of that profit off it you know maybe gainful Employment Office traveling but it's almost an unrealistic dream since I don't know if I would actually want to do that but if  if I had to pick some kind of dream existence he of traveling getting paid to travel and meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun  well I like like a mention what I like by the way I like trying different kinds of food different Cuisine so I think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people sing different ways of life would be that is what I like about traveling I like experiencing new things I think that'd be nice so you know despite the fact I said I'd like the familiarity of La there's also funded discovering you think so I think when I travel that's that's what I like to do just checking things out  I would like to be you know if I could make a living doing that that be great  one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip I took  I think of what one one more exciting trip  well my my family is from Eastern Europe so one of the trips I took with my parents when I was fourteen was I went to Austria Hungary and Romania and you know getting to see some of those old guy been a few times before but I was when I was little so I don't really have too much primary plus I didn't really process things quite the same as when I was kind of more of age so I got to see you know my family is old you know Hometown you know that we have a family like tomb so I got to see that than just these old buildings and just a different way of life I really like that you know seeing my parents old friends you know and so that was pretty funny was very different I was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment do you know I left them know the school year so is just like going from no Suburban America to traveling around kind of you know taking these old trains and Sandy's castles and he's old like hundreds of the year old Townsend  I don't know if it was for everyone you know I don't know it would be great for everybody by I really enjoyed it  but it's the best  oh that's that's a good question I do I probably one of the things I do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom I used to watch the office a lot so I kind of know when that's on so I'll turn that on you know just kind of zone out a little bit too you know if you like it characters in and hearing the jokes that are still funny for some reason or maybe like eating some kind of comfort food you know I try not to eat too much fast food at all but like in and out I really like going there so if I have to unwind once every few months maybe I'll do that or I really like to read especially like I'll read the day's events you know that that really relax with me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on some of the World II Soul I'll read the headlines and I really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me so I really enjoy that that's the way I do to relax  I would say I'm pretty great at it at all though I don't I think my nature makes it pretty easy pranks that pretty easy I don't I don't get very upset easily at all so it's not much of a challenge to control my temper at  yeah I don't really have anger issues that it's difficult for me to get angry so I don't I don't I don't really have much trouble with that at all  last time I argued with somebody was probably  I don't even know I a mean small disagreement see no I might have had with family or friends about things but just a full-on argument I got I can't even remember it's been years I did I don't really argue too much I try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my in my personal life I don't really see anything to be gained by and I kind of naturally repel away from it so I don't have much to say about arguing  what's something you feel guilty about  I feel guilty about I would say that you know something sometimes I don't really  I feel like I may be having made the most of my potential yet in life I think that I could definitely do more despite the fact I work a lot I feel like I there's always more opportunity out there that they were missing I feel like you know sometimes down time I feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that I could be doing that I'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been I took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or  running late I really don't like running late although it happens more than I'd like to write I don't know why I feel guilty about that I don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like you're my time is not more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true  tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  nothing immediately comes to mind I well the last car accident I got into it was a few years ago I guess I wish it hadn't happened. I wish I could erase it from my memory but I ate was driving in rush-hour traffic and you know it I thought the cars in front of me where we're going you know at least for a little Mia 10-15 feet but it turns out that that stops so you know slow rear end collision but it was still very important I was just you know I just felt like I was paying attention one second and the next second you know I was just like reaching for something on the lights in the passenger seat and then I ate I smacked into the car in front of me in  I wish I had a theft and absolutely I know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad enough for me financially any of the people I got into an accident while we were fine but I was you know they they didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damage is but that it was just a horrible timing so I wished I hadn't happened  but that sucks it did suck I've over now but I suck  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep well I'm a pretty good sleeper although I naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job allows me fortunate pretty flexible schedule but on the same token I wish I could wear like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because I just I wind up staying up till 1 or 2 every night and it's just too late you know even though I can get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half of my sleep is like in the head of early daylight hours I wish I were more able to sleep. Go to sleep at like 10 or 11 and then sleep in or wake up earlier as opposed to  going to sleep later and waking up later  I'm pretty feeling pretty good. I've been I have no complaints physically and you health-wise I feel good you're my relationships with my my family and friends are good  everything is great so far I had absolutely no no real complaints as far as how I'm feeling. Myself or anything like that  no no I've been fairly consistent with my behavior in my thoughts I think that  everything is been been pretty okay pretty said he no no nothing traumatic nothing kind of resurfacing for the past nothing of the sort has this happened there is happening  no  no  well I think there's plenty of things everybody regrets yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things  in my life yeah like I said I I do regret you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days he know I there's a pretty of time in my early twenties where I I didn't work for a while I just I hung out with a lot of friends yeah I guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just you know we we got high everyday or it seemed like every day I don't know it was just this is kind of like a throwaway. Of my life  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  I would say that  it's important to  210 gauge with the world I think I I think I kind of dropped off in the world a little bit I think it's also I would say that it's important to  recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what what kind of potential do you know if you try tivities that you can expect from the people you surround yourself with I think that I would say also that kind of try to focus on what I wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking while you know things will work out which eventually they do but I think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that approach is kind of fatalistic and I think that I would say you know just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule in life is not a race but I would say that it was it important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you no idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and thinking of things will fall into place  tell me about a time when someone made you  well I I  I guess some people I I don't especially  take it even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason I think that at least myself I sort of have things figured out although I am not sure I'm wrong about that so I think just maybe in terms of like a group work. Done professionally or academically you know when when some of my work is kind of picked apart or were scrutinized I'd I don't deal well with that and I had taken more personally than I should  show me about a year-and-a-half ago I was working on a research project at work and somebody with much less those three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it in those somebody just out of God College you know  went over what we have done and you know it's just kind of rewording things and it seems just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and I kind of took first offense to that just because I thought I had a lot more experience and more education and it was unnecessary that you know I thought the whole thing was a waste of time and you know I just  I didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to attend this earlier we do all our work or or even to not not to redo it but to 2 edited or to proofread I guessed it to make any kind of you know qualitative changes I I just thought that it was a really bad idea and I thought that you know I should have viewed it this way but I thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like an affront to us would work on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call  most memorable experiences  I guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my the first real trip I took by myself I took the the Amtrak to to New Mexico and I was out there exploring things for about 10 days on my own so that was kind of the longest. Time up till that point and I was in my 23 maybe at the time that I had really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone I was in parts of New Mexico where there's no cell phone reception at the time  it is very memorable because I was on it on my own I feel like I was really you know exposed to the things I wouldn't have seen if I had to had traveling companions it was a lot of fun  tell me about the last time you felt  I live a very happy recently I didn't for that I'm getting married in a few months I got engaged on Labor Day 2012 this whole process Casino album a meeting some of them we'd be kind of progressed very quickly realize where we would recognize her we were so I've been a pretty happy state the past it's been 11 months now but yeah so I think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family I think those have been very happy times New Years was happy you know happy. Of my life right now so  yeah thank you  what sort of  sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets I'd say also  you know helpful, I'm relaxed Maybe  intelligent you know likes to recycle I know that's so suck that they would say  hey what else I think that best friend might say that I like animals I've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person I mean an animal person sees me I also you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans  I'd say one of the most proud of in my life  well I'm pretty happy with the level of Education I've gotten I'm also going back and starting the fall I'm starting a Ph.D program so I'm happy about that happy about you know breaking so my bad habits from the past that I'd say if I'm proud of anything it's that you don't have a strong faith relationship I go to church off and I'm very happy about that I don't have pride is the right word but my relationship to my family and friends are all very good I'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about 10 years ago you know that the change I'm I'm happy and proud of that  no problem have a good day thank you  goodbye  so",0

372,okay and please  are you okay with  Des  come  pretty good kind of  Los Angeles  the thing I like about ale the weather  what are some things you don't really  it's not easy to meet people  can you tell me about  well it just feels like people aren't out very much they're like that movie in Crash where people are just in their cars all the time it feels like that  no  not too much  child development  well I have a son and I wanted to know how to be a good mom and so I wanted to know about the stages that he would be going through and be able to relate better to him  are you happy  I am  kind of I'm trying to get it started again in the fall  I love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me  I like the right  tell me about that  I've written some children's books and I've just been doing research looking and so getting my books published it's only like two that I've written so far but they're pretty good I got some good feedback on them for my critique groups  it's about  a little boy that surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with him and if it's a bit like a really  he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life  you find it easy to be a parent  I know I have had some issues with nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so I know I was single mom it was the hardest thing I think in the world  so  how do I cope  all right now  I didn't have very many coping skills are mechanisms so  that was the problem  it's so spontaneous  make the stuff that comes out of kids mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face  well when I said was younger  once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me Mom I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend  so  yeah pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me I need to not be single anymore  okay  the hardest thing  not wanting to screw it up  have a lot of stress and pressure  that  every little thing is going to be in make a difference in matter  and what kind of person like it turns out to be  and  so  it's a lot of stress on yourself  yeah  yeah definitely  I think  I'm different from my mom  because I'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction I welcome it you know I welcome  getting to know who my child is right now and  not try to mold them into somebody that I want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person  say it again  who someone that's a positive influence  I don't really have anybody  like that  what I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  hey I know it's not a lie but it's the best I've got  what do you do to relax  well  I've tried to meditate sometimes but I don't really stick with it often enough  I've tried to like go for walks but I don't always do that and I will always stick with it  so  that's about it  I say  I'm a little below average meaning that I get angry more than most people do I think  when was the  last night it was on the telephone I was arguing with my husband we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment I should say and she's got four people living in one room so  it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know I'm just saying to him that I told you so I told you if my sister moved in here  they said there was going to be a mess in the house and she's going to be asking for things you don't really want to do that's just how my sister is so the house is messy and it's crowded and everyday they're asking for brides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore and I just saying that he's going to have to find a way to deal with it because  he asked for it in my opinion  where does  oh I got time to Bumble right now  but now my mind is losing custody of my son right now like I've been arguing with my stepmom and my step-sister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how I want them to be treated like they don't have any boundaries  and I believe that boundaries are important in establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss them around and stuff anyways because of this they're going to be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that  yeah there any saying that I'm not a good mom because I believe in having boundaries and we had very different ideas about child-raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's death wife  and she's  she really does it she's really far removed from how I was raised and I want to raise my child more similar to how I was raised where you we had some independent that we had some boundaries that we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us  where's my stepmom she invents no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine with your grandparents but the problem is that I live with him sometimes and when I'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not  trying to go and break all of my rules  anyway  yam  in that moment  just really frustrated because they don't listen to me  I fell  disrespected I feel like invisible I feel  just angry  that they're taking away my right to pair it and it's something that I worked really hard to do I went to school and I study Child Development I read all the magazines and I read the books and I really  I know what I'm talkin about I feel confident and my parenting skills in my parenting abilities and they have these people that have it done the same thing I worked as hard as I have to be a good parent try and tell me that I'm a bad parent  it's really  hard to believe so I feel very disrespected and acknowledge angry frustrated  all those things  I take I take Benadryl to help me sleep  and I'm so  my doctor gave me that give you Benadryl told me I can take it to help me sleep  last night I was crying  before I went to sleep  so what time do you start start running through your head at night when you're in bed  but I tried to push them out and then I got up and I took my Benadryl so I can go to sleep more easily  I need triggered by something  yeah I'm always thinking about my son  I wish you was with me  and how unfair everything is it's happening  I like I don't deserve  do you have my son taken from me because I'm a really good mom you know  and I'm too hard on myself so  but I am a good mom and I feel confident that I'm a good mom or Jess  I don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad to send dad does he has more money than me  and right now I'm trying to be okay with it because  I know he can do more for him  financially than I could  that doesn't mean I'm not a good mom  I'm pretty depressed I'm on antidepressants  take Wellbutrin I've been on it for a couple weeks now  I think they're working I don't know I'm not as  down as I was I mean I got here today I got dressed and I'm here today so...  my husband complains a lot he says  I'm not the same person  that I was when he married me  he said it was fun and I was positive and  I was all these other optimistic things that's another thing is on the phone telling you last night and  and  I'm not those things anymore which is true I mean we got married a year ago  and that my son was taken shortly after and it was just such  a shock  and  I've just been trying to get back from it  but it's been hard  did I think I had a problem before I found out  found out what  oh  yeah I like crying a lot sometimes I cry all the time  play  my family would invite me to family events  and I would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there  toram  I don't know  it's just all the crying I think and like I said my husband letting me know that I'm not the same person  so  he's disappointed that I feel bad even that I'm not the same person that he knew I feel bad about that to another thing I'm feeling bad about you know  you still go to therapy now  yes I do I try  I feel like the therapist useful  yeah it's nice to talk about your problems I go in there and I cry every week so I need to have a set time every week where I can go in and cry  that's I mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes I feel better afterwards  yeah  and she helps me make decisions you know  help me to be more proactive in my life  well I'm looking for  jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here why don't you work there have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about how did you go back to school at so I went and applied to go back to school you know I'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either  so I'm trying to find a work and I applied for college  in the fall I got accepted to Dominguez Hills  so I may be going back to school in the fall right now I'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kind of stuff just giving me ideas  that life isn't over there still more you know I could be doing this like like yeah  everything's always bittersweet  I don't know  last time it was really happy  I don't know  my ideal weekend  oh  I don't have a lot of money cuz I'm not working right now so really my weekends are just fed  reading maybe that I can't believe I can't pay much attention when I'm reading have a short attention span I can only read a couple of chapters  but lately I say that's what I've been doing is reading  something I read  okay  I need to go to USC they have these nights were  they have things like book signings or poetry and art is called Visions & voices so I like to go out to their events  and I usually enjoy those  about two weeks ago Deborah Harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches  so like I said I'm trying to be a writer so I try to go especially to the book signings  and see what it's like to be an officer who's talking to a crowd and signing books  what are you most proud of in your life  my son  how your best friend describe you  I don't have any friends  my best qualities  I'm smart  I'm good looking  I'm really  I like a hard worker I am dedicated Psych self-improvement  that's all I can think of right now  okay  goodbye  press the buzzer now,13
373,give me Tessa levels or 9  Alka  how do I get an avatar of this stuff too  now she's going to ask you some questions and when she's done she will let you know and I'm all right  thank you very much  creative  and please  are you okay with  yes  doing okay  North Carolina  yep  almost four years ago  Majin Buu  I graduated college and internship out here for production company so I started doing that with the group of friends and then got work after that and enjoy the city so much and have been working on here since  how often do you go back to  probably at the most three times a year maybe twice using the holidays maybe one random trip in there  it's Ellie's only now just starting to come home to me in the sense of that respect or like I was going home was going home now going home. Going back to see my family and seeing some friends but I might by Fillmore I feel like I belong in Los Angeles I do back at home  things you really like about a leg  add food on the weather goes without saying I factory sources are like feeling I like that the things I want to do a much easier much more accessible here than they would be in North Carolina so it I feel like I'm unable to Upper Sue heel of my passions Ambitions in a much more functional unrealistic way living Los Angeles than I am in North Carolina  I mean the cost of living is in great but soon come to I always tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much research so many resources out here so it's not even expensive is New York or Boston so I thought the worst but I also don't mean is a little bit annoying that every time I do want to go home and safe Lighting on the drive I can but mean really conceivably drive home for the holidays it's been 3 or 4 days and chair and just not practical so it's unfortunate so far away in that respect but geography  I studied history and media studies and production  yes I work as a freelance writer and producer  in college I realized I was pretty good at it and I knew there's way to monetize that and I came out here and worked a little bit in the public sector and trying to understand those jobs that way and realize I could make more money have more control over my schedule in my life if I did it for you and so I've been doing it now for a little over a year now  great  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I do my love traveling guy try to go somewhere new for a good. Of time about every 7-Day months to try to make something so I was in Barcelona just recently and I'm planning on going to either Vietnam or even back to Europe in a couple months up  awesome  show me about traveling  enjoy the break from routine I think that while it's nice to wake up and have a vague idea where your day is going after a few months you can get very much kind of caught at the menu pigeon hole is your thought process your expectations for today I love going to foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything I do that day is going to be brand new and totally different than what I would be doing if I was in Los Angeles Earp and my run retain so I declare that I love food so it's great to just eat a lot of food I love in the places where they were originally created  yeah sure I went to Barcelona like I said a few months ago and that was mainly because I had a friend who was living there for 6-7 months and she kept asking to come out and I finally I was at the point work I've been working so much for months on end I felt like I deserved a break so I went there for two weeks and he has won the healthiest smartest things I've done in a while so I reminded me again how important this for me at least two out to travel it to get out of the world  I'm very outgoing I love talking to people and conversing even virtual people I lost you  relax I listen play music a lot I like to read like to go see movies a cook I cook a lot so I enjoy cooking my girlfriend and I are currently separated by distance so I haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very sad and obviously so I'll talk with her as much as I can but I'm a pretty simple taste  okay  yep I have lost her but I don't know if is a mix-up you have a direct response that's okay no problem  this is awkward isn't  I don't have much of a temper so very good I guess I don't really get angry easily or quickly and well when I do I'm usually aware of it enough that I can kind of formulate how I feel and why I'm doing that way and what I want to be done about it so so it's pretty pretty so pretty easy-going guy in that respect  nopon Sage probably something petty over like misremembering when  something was done or I get the date on something or like a fact I wasn't even emotionally filled and it was just about yeah I think it's probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to San Francisco and it was even argue as much as just the other person thinking the other person's message remembering self even Reno small or big situations very difficult for me to actually feel and rage by guess in the classical sense of the word  okay  tell me about a situation that you wish you would  true think I'm not one one for regrets  how much recently did a project like a a film and the subject matter had a little to do with like an ex girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it I made a point I can I don't want to send her directly so I want her to think that I was doing it to spite her face by did Center brother just because he enjoys my working I said I want to see stuff and I may be that she might have could have misconstrued as being passive aggressive I don't know but but yeah I mean that so bad I thought about that I don't really regret as much as like maybe I could have just let everyone else who wasn't so sure about if I should do stumble upon as opposed to me dragging it to them so just my thoughts are  tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to make hardest decision I've ever had to make  it was actually probably probably that was even hard decision with Excel with that the same as score for the mission of us probably cuz I knew I had to break up with her after some stuff happened and is the focus I cared about her great deal but I'll send him to me it wasn't hard to rival the conclusion that I had to break up with her the same time to it was not the easiest thing to try to go through that process it's being on a roller coaster that you're very much aware of how terrible or frightening is going to be but you know you have to get on the roller coaster so that's probably a recent memory  Just Cabinets for reasons that I this person is probably not the best person for me so I said it was a it was I didn't have to I don't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out it was pretty clear sign and have no regrets about doing it now I feel very strongly then about it I felt so I still feel very strongly that I made the right choice.  How easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I can beat it can be tough there will be I feel like it's either 5 if I've exhausted myself during the day between work and the I buy started exercise has a huge help but but I'd say that it's kind of when I get to bed and I never know how it's going to go sometimes it's sometimes I wake up within an hour of falling asleep and can't go back to sleep or Asia periodically keep getting up it up so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but I am especially having my my current girlfriend not around because she's a very big source of comfort I also like that but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and asleep can be consumed as a person that but I'm respecting that someone actually I feel like I don't eat too much sleep I if I can get find get four to six hours in pretty good shape that day so  how have you been feeling  anxious I guess more just dance just whenever I get off of the assignment there's always just a question like what am I what's going on necks and if I don't have the next project lined up so it's always that nervousness some in the past something usually does come up so we have the president of it usual working up until it dies you always a little anxious and depressed because it's like a you know I chose not very much a lifestyle that while I get that a lot of control and economy over my life it also is all on me in or do it again with sometimes I buy I'm a very jealous of that if you'll just waking up going to the office for 8 hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people are our company carry them through when it's a little tough the words like me if I have an off-day if I'm a sick day that no work gets stuck on you know I'm a small business that has one employee  how do you cook  how do I cope with them I assume you mean I guess you could work without I cope with the May the better answer be how do I cope with that lifestyle just I got a much more he's doing something I'm still learning and figure out how to how to handle as far as not just like I know what the other how rewarding work is when I do it with all Sophia what's the most efficient way to live the life you know how do I what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the expectation I should have for myself in a given year Wentz realistic what's helpful and that's something that I'm sure will take years and years to do but I feel like as long as I'm getting better at it then it's progress rent  have you been diagnosed with depression yes definitely will once and then probably out if I would have gone back I was gone in high school probably live in second time but I feel like it's one of those things that is something I have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know how I feel like I'm pretty happy person for the most part but has a as long as this bike is that what people are very creative or people do lots of the Mind attends the Fallen I get that to self esteem thing cuz it's so hard to feel so it was her so easy I supposed to get in your own head about that  this is within a year so I probably was feeling  awesome just haven't been there before I was kind of easy to figure out. You know it's going to happen again so I feeling the symptoms again  and going through those emotions and feel like okay at first I was kind of hoping to be some I could kind of working myself but I'm I realize or just stupid for me to try to fight the Battle of my own so I went numb started seeing a therapist  really back this is my right just couldn't sleep at all I got to get maybe an hour of sleep at night at best on those sleeping at all had just no no no drive to do anything weather symbols brush my teeth or clean my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that's like oh this is all in my head inside even look at some of them so the general just a general malaise that comes with depression  I know I just finished up finished up I mean since I didn't graduate and like that but I got to a point where I felt like I kind of talked through as much as I could talk through and I moved on and another place my life is in a can of a good good work going to cash checks that I was working on something I really cared about now with someone I care about greatly and there's such a potential opportunity for me to do I have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that I feel like therapy was not necessary also I just don't have the time to do with as much as work goes on some  oh I definitely I think having someone you can confide in who isn't your friend or family member who won't you know I have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to come early like that is definitely something I can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on someone of a routine basis  I don't know I'm I'm coming from believer that all those things like those things are connected haunt you are also there for a reason like that my sister died when I was about 12 years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very  trust traumatic thing for me and it felt like I grew up a lot that day so it's at my house so difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child I don't want to forget those things got the bitter Berry interval to how I cope with life and how I perceive hardships and obstacles and haven't got image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing so easy to kind of  you idolize your pants on so I like my father but you know he's he's a guy like me and as I get older and some easily identify with the man he is  syberia 16 or 6  I kind of like the notion that there is a you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you to realize how people how much people didn't think about you it's really hard to tell a 16 year old and I'm at the point of telling a six-year-old but I'm P I feel like a specially when you're high school until I get to nowadays you live in Los Angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and I still am very I find out someone is upset with me or doesn't like me a father's me to a great dealer I hate letting people down so I would like to come to help your place or just knowing this and I'm just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so  very compassionate guy on there for my friends I'm pretty selfless in that respect I have a good humor about things we even with people with being depressed or depression I can joke about it something you know I'm not a morbid to press mortise Theo I'm aware of when I'm I'm low and I treated as such and I don't know I don't try to deny it or try to like and that's why I I have a I'm a pretty practical person in that respect I don't think I even I'm depressed I'll take it out on people or I don't think people feel told me they don't seem to mention that I've been going through a depression know what you said and I for one feel like when I do go through so I don't have one can just tell and I'm just a Smoking Gun of sadness basically but you know I stand to carry it pretty well enough I don't I don't lose sight of the reality of what I know is happening so  I was on my my girlfriend came she was in Thailand for 3 weeks and then she supposed to go to Spain for two but you can't sweat trip and came back and stay with me for about ten days and yeah I know I love her she's great she's the coolest person I know and so much fun and she when she's around makes me so happy and so having her for 10 days and we just had like normal we very rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh I see for 5 days and then one of us has to go somewhere so they have 10 days is normal or we could just cook dinner at home like line bed and read books are like that was great. It makes me so happy that I have someone that I can do it within just feels so practical and Feel So Right  how your best friend describe you  you're so stressed about my mama I'm a good guy like guy but I know I don't know I don't think I screw people over I don't I'm a good friend to have I'm I'm there for people I look out for people I care about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and I try to make sure you know it with a lot of my friends being on the East Coast I try to carve out time to make sure they know I think about them and I called him and so I feel like I feel like people who count me as their friend them probably one of the better ones since the sense that I I know how much I appreciate and respect the friendships we have  thanks Ali  strapped up,9
374,forget you can ask you some questions to let you know when she's done and  okay  are you okay with this yes  pretty good  Alexandria Virginia  I'm to La end of 2001  yeah it's crazy  a couple times a year usually like for holidays  it is it's very different  I think it's a lot more mellow it's way more like Suburbia it's nice if there's something comforting about it but it's always like I got a little Restless when I'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action  I went to grad school at USC  it was it wasn't bad I mean my my program that I was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that I really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like my life is not my own so that made it kind of easier I guess and also I was like in a community of people that I went to school at so automatically I knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad  I had an epiphany one day I was out of undergrad I was kind of floundering a little bit I didn't really know what I wanted to do and just one day I kind of was like you know what am I really excited about one of my really passionate about and I realize that movies are the thing that I love the most and I most passionate about that is how I decided to go to film School  are you still doing that  a little bit yes and no it's that sound like in a little bit of a transitional. Right now but yeah like for the last several years I've been producing like freelance producer  that is so the question of the moment  I think that  I don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but I know it's sort of what I want it cuz basically like I've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and I know that that is like exhausting and I don't want to do that anymore so I'm looking for something that's stable you know full-time nice benefits and I want to stay in the entertainment industry and I like you know what I love about pretty thing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and assertive never know what is going to get thrown out you that I bet you know it's always interesting and exciting so I'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good  place for me to be where I can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of like room to to grow and advance and all that  yeah  I can't see your shoes I I like to travel I don't know that I haven't really been doing it a lot lately but I have you know in the past. And Fairmount  I want the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people I think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and and things and just experienced different ways of living in different languages in different cultures  let's see I went to Costa Rica a couple years ago my best friend from growing up she and I went for like 10 days and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time and beautiful and we just spent like we went to three different places and just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last picture we ended up with this little Beach town so I'll buy that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like an amazing physical exertion like doing zip lines and all these hikes to the by the time I got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity  but I also I'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like my own of each with a book so it sort of hit everything  hey  but it's the best I've got.  What should I do to relax  I mean depending where I am like if it's you know something at work or something and I'm stressed out I just will you know kind of take a minute and just like breathing really deeply and try to calm myself down that way if I'm home I might just like you know they're on a movie or like a TV show that I really liked and just that gives a sense of play sort of Escape release  pretty good I don't I mean it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often  the last time I argue with someone with my mom and it was about money  I felt really frustrated because I felt like she was like judging me unfairly  and I was upsetting  it's good you know they live across the country for me so I don't get to see them that often but like I usually talk to  my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive they are you know like when I go back home to visit like I I enjoy hanging out with them with a good time by Timmy have a pretty pretty good relationship  play I feel guilty about  I guess because I'm like in this term job-hunting phase I feel guilty sometimes that I'm not like doing enough you know if like there are times where it's at their day is or maybe like I should have sent out a few more resumes are done more stuff like I I feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  usually it's pretty easy that lasts the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good  I'm not really sure I haven't figured it out but I just had more like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason I've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like I wake up sometimes I wake myself a king but it's weird so yeah it's just I don't know  I need triggered by something  not that I have been able to identify I mean I guess maybe I'm like more stressed than usual just cuz like my job situation is like influx but I don't know if there's no lick event  cranky  I value a good sleep and I'm so used to it so it's just that it's not a good feeling  not really no  yes  like  I think I'm like October or November although this is the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like  many many years ago  I felt like I was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it  just having a hard time  functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like  it took so much energy so yeah I just I wasn't really  functioning normally  yeah  yes  yes sometimes more than others but yeah overall I would say so  I think that Sarah P is good for me because it  help me focus on  my sort of patterns and also like  just like observing how I am like responding to certain situations and just I guess it's because we have more hate and like kind of self-awareness so that as opposed to just like  kind of just reacting to situations I'm like just like noticing more what is going on and it just helps to  I don't know it's just helpful  I don't know  play not good that I can think of I can't think of anything  that may be over  over Christmas being at home with my family  well it just was  that was like I was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and  like yeah I live alone here I have a dog but so I just had a long. Of  feeling not great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kind of wishing that my family was around me so when I was there with them it just  it just felt very like  safe and comfortable and not just sort of like you no more Miss Amelia land brace  I think she would describe me as  funny and smart and  a good listener non-judgemental  I don't know  got enough  okay  so this happens  the last like job that I had I mean I was it wasn't technically I was a freelancer but I was working for this company for like  a year-and-a-half to two years and  had a very small company that had a really good relationship with my boss and he threw up out of nowhere  told me that he was like downsizing basically and  essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that I would get paid fees per project so he looks at me down in this conversation was like you are major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company that if they're really coming back like you probably noticed things are going really slow and I was like yeah he's like so I'm going to have to stop paying you your retainer and this is a total surprise and I was like okay and he went on to talk about how he I would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came to the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though I wouldn't be getting a retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like I wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the money that I was making  but and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work I love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me such a emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road I had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing with the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when I was in there I stop that  this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were to plant we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so yeah so it just like  it was a really shity way to be like fired without being told that I was fired and it was just like  that is the reason I would like to if I could I would erase that from my mind is because I can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way it's like it's still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kind of like angry when I think about it so yeah that was very long explanation  a very loyal person I am smart I am organized I  very like carrying kind  I'm conscientious and I work hard  man  I think  2  be more confidence  and  less passive to really  like focus on  what I wanted a things that I know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to prevent themselves  probably just some of the  relationships that I formed with people  just like really you know deep friendships  you're welcome  bye  just just like right before you walked in  I take this off,2
375,I'm in the right spot  that's very good animation now  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  I was created to talk to people and it's safe  are you okay with this yes  good  the nice day  the South Bay  can I ask you that question 2  okay that's where I'm from basically like the South Bay on it  things you really like about a leg  not much I've been wanting to move anyways  just to get a changeup everybody thinks La is like everything is the best but it's too many people and too much traffic  I can't see your shoes  driving and seeing new stuff  last year I went to Sacramento  from here and stayed out for like a month living in my VW bus with my wife it was kind of cool camping  what made you decide to  want to have fun some different  art  are you still doing that  know a little bit  try doing what you're doing  I'm really interested in coming up with new ideas and stuff too  awesome  outgoing  I haven't been doing much to do relax relaxing ladybug the beach  good  I rooted my brother last night actually how about him  talking to me with more respect as a person  I was mad I want to fight  it's good but sometimes there just  they're too caught up in what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings  I guess my brother he's just  he's just tents because of his situation and he tried to brush it off on me  wasting money cuz I'm married now  you done anything to avoid it  yeah I'm not doing it  something like probably taking some candy from the store or no no taking money for my mom and I was like really young  why was like I was in junior high school and I think I took like 20 from her purse and bought candy for my friends and I felt guilty they're like the same day  that got you in trouble  probably a house by the beginning of my stupid activities  all my life for the past couple years  my wife  how do you know that  I'm married to her we've known each other for about two years I met her at an art walk  great checks we went to USC to  the past couple days has been  kind of hard but I used to go to sleep good  I think I'm kind of I'm picking up Snappy  positive optimistic  yeah  like what  I've been thinking more positive positively lately and I want to put a lot of stuff in action so I've been trying to train my mind into  knowing that stuff is going to come to me speaking to the universe  easy if you just try it and do it everybody's got a spirit  okay  have you ever been diagnosed with  no  Deerfield  no I just told you I feel positive  I was happy happy yesterday because I let you know I made a couple good decisions  wanting to be positive and stay away from negative people  okay  what are you most proud of in your life  being alive knowing god  how your best friend describe you  I don't know  I don't know I can't think of something else  Montague Iowa  sex  exercising  waking up positive and having a good meal in the morning  I think driving to Sacramento that time  no  don't smoke cigarettes and watch how you spend your money  are you going to sell my ideas and thoughts  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever  I can't be around  it worked that time  I like to go hiking,5
376,hashemite hair you see what you look like oh my God  all right now  so this picture is not based on a real woman at all  okay so when she said I'll just wait for the buttons not working and I'll come back to you okay  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  yes  I'm doing okay it's still morning so  I'm from the East Coast Massachusetts  yes  I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter  I haven't been back to the last time I was back there was that three years ago for Christmas  LA's very hustle-bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA and which Becky is the East Coast that the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors are friendly to your neighbors and Tammy way that you see in the street  so yeah  well since I was a kid I was fairly young at first it was rough I was getting in trouble a little bit in school but after all that surpassed I did fine in high school and stopping even took some college courses  well I love the beach and I love the mountains I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes  do you travel  no not at all  it's not interested I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger went to Ensenada but other than that I'm not interested in leaving United States especially with what's been going on lately overseas  okay  actually child psychology and I was in the nursing program for a little bit but I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out  that's right  I don't have one to be honest I admire people that are doing the job that they love I mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money I'll grade is that so  I'm pretty outgoing when I meet somebody at first I might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not but once I decided I like that person or whatever I I talked a lot so  hey  yes  I like watching movies I like I used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book  not good at times I have a  some Outburst every once in awhile to say depends on how angry I get  I yesterday and it was with my partner and actually be honest I don't remember what it was about It's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and I don't appreciate that and if I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever I'm going to stand up for myself  at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and I say what I say what's on my mind I do not purposely going to hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but I won't be bullied and I won't be may I Won't Back Down if I feel like I'm being challenged so  last year my mother died  so  I wish I handled that differently  it up to it that upset me  so  tell me about  I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that'll upset me more  that is terrible sometimes I sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day you're tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I can't I get up and then I'm wide awake I'll go out and living room turn on the TV and watch TV I'm lucky if I get 3 to 4 hours sleep  are they triggered by something  maybe because I do have a lot of my mind you know thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and in all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it  but it's not difficult it's just frustrating cuz when your mind goes on overtime mode it I just affects everything your concentration your sleep you're eating  everything so  I don't look grouchy especially in the morning I'm not a morning person I like the nights but I don't like the morning that's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee so other than that I'm okay  well I've been I've been depressed for quite some time and I'm still having difficulty cuz after my mother died four months later my uncle died so I had two deaths last year so I'm still reeling and trying to  get myself back together just recently I've started pursuing like interest that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened  I just I might get angry little easier I sleep alot I eat I overeat  I get tired very easily cuz I'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like I'm struggling to get through the day  yes I have a psychiatrist that prescribe me medication on a regular basis  oh I was diagnosed quite some time ago probably 10 to 15 years ago and it's just something I've never gotten over I don't know whether or not you can so I've always taken the medicine  I was  arguing with everybody in my family my friends and stuff like that and I was feeling desperate and hopeless and I had attempted to take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then they start treating me I start seeing a therapist so  well right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance will cover the psychiatrist and a therapist but I am working with a friend of mine who had no some Avenues to go to seek help for a therapist and I don't know if that's really going to help me I mean sometimes it depends on what kind of therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and Ramble On and you're thinking my God what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions  tell  change it  they said I haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist medication  there's been no changes really  I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away I was her caregiver and  even though a lot of times I filled I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her I still was a heck of a lot happier  then I am now  tell  I would say when my son was born years ago  do you find it easy to be a parent  I'm not a parent anymore he passed away  so  and that was difficult as well  I'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done even though sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained and  you know those qualities are are admirable and people that can keep their word and and be responsible  excuse me  oh I have lots of regrets  things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about but you know I met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you don't dwell on the situation but this is what I'm just a lot easier said than done  I'm at the advice kind of get person you know I don't really  give my friends ain't kind of advice I mean  I find most of the time people don't listen to you anyway so why bother I just State my opinion that's all  what right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot and I'll sleep eat sleep to eat and so now I'm kind of like on a diet trying to lose this weight his very unhealthy for me  I think it's been a long time  actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy I haven't been to a movie in ages I don't I used to go out shopping all the time I don't now so it's been it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now  spend your ideals  my weekends like on Saturday I'm usually working on Sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house  run some errands go shopping for food you know that kind of thing so it's not if I was younger you know it would be fun you know got clubbing or whatever but I'm too old for that now  really there's nothing that I can think of  there's nothing that I can be proud of  set a good like comedy or whatever I like to watch that  sometimes my partner might do something stupid which I like because I like make fun of them  but that's it you know could maybe go out for a walk on the beach that's it  okay  no problem thank you  bye  there's somebody talk for her or she's just talking to me really  okay,12
377,"so when she's finished I'll just wait for a little more buttons not working I'm pleased  are you okay  yeah go ahead  okay  I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a bit and then they lived overseas for a little while and then I move to California  I moved here at the end of June of last year so I guess it's been 8 months something like that  at the most probably twice a year  Well my own town is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and Farms so the opposite of LA  good question I have always wanted to live in California so but I had to living in in the Central Coast  and I just have been coming down to La like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me that client I had who is really the main like Financial  Main Financial Source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give Ally a try and see what happens so  I give it a shot and here I am  no not at all very very big city  I lived in Dublin in Ireland was it which is also a big city but you know European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy and  yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and  I'm not much of a world Explorer. I love to travel I love it I live in Ireland and I traveled by the Morocco and I was in Costa Rica on my spend some time in Mexico so yeah  I love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go  I want to hear about one of your trips  sure well  I guess trying to think which is my favorite time of night there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco's incredible it was like 12 days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and  yeah it's a really really cool culture that was fun  my trip to Ireland I actually visited there which is why I decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being in a bison and leaving Dublin and going to sound to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is time is everyone is these pictures of Ireland or you know you see in films and it's green and Lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experienced it it's like the pictures don't do it justice so incredible  I might have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies  no I use my English in Psychology I work in marketing Communications so actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes in to comes into play and so does my  I guess my undergrad degree in English but really like I took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I I wasn't wanting to teach  what made you decide to do  too cuz I'm not clear on the question  okay  my job  wow  yeah my dream job is  being a  a motivational speaker and trainer and coach  I'm in traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people  my relationships pretty good actually I  I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic I saw her sporadically growing up I lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them like the family I grew up with so but I got in communication with my biological mother  last May and we've been  clear things up and have been in communication since then  well not sure what you mean but if you're referring to being communication with my birth mother is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and they do not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah  I'm shy  time to relax I do a number of things I like to do yoga and I don't have the money for it right now I love to dance I love to read I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really retarded is my battery actually probably more than anything else  I like to be with friends I love arts and trying new restaurants  yeah all those things are  both relaxing and I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and today experiences of my life so  yeah  how are you at controlling your temper  depends if I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it  last night I argued with somebody probably would have to be  Ono is with the LA times that the newspaper delivery  yeah that was the last time  tell me about  yeah the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of it didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until  I'm late I don't know afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place so I mean for service at and it would pay for it for every day so I'm yeah I was just really irritated and then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so amazing Ricky L E X I was angry with people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me I was pretty frustrated  Noel there quite a few of those  I think about 1  the other day I had a phone call  and I'm going to coaching program and  it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with  someone who's not my couch and that hasn't been explained to me it's part of the program so it's in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my God I have all these people I have to be accountable to and you know I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just  so yeah I wasn't  I was an angry I was just I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it but  yeah I could have  certainly just been okay with what for was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  large decision while there's been a few  why is moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision now it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging  that was the hardest decision was the first time that I  moved away from my family I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that's a pretty tough decision at that point my family had been within an hour's Drive of where I lived an hour hour-and-a-half and now they're going to be a 12-hour drive away or a plane right away so that was challenging  oh lots of things  I love Colorado Colorado is beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor outdoor community in Colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and we're interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado to seem like a really natural fit hell yeah and then I found a job that I liked the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and that all came together just move  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I was totally unrelated question  relatively easily it just depends on like what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11:30 then  and having to go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those are five-star from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily  I'm sure they are I mean I'm in another transition state and moving out of  out of the house that I live in right now or take care of an elderly woman  yeah and I just I have to find  the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just didn't her state of being anxious exhausting and I'd really depressing  living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again if I honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation  I feel trapped and helpless like this nothing I can  no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I did I don't know I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all  so yeah I feel pretty crappy  I have in the past year  oh a long time I was 15 I think 14 so it was over 20 years ago  are you suicidal  you feel down  oh yeah I fell down  I don't actually now  well I originally stopped  with my therapist because we had completed I mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and and then I began therapy again later on think I wish it was in my early thirties and then I we ended that because I moved to Ireland so  yeah I'm in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like I I don't go into therapy thinking I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous  I think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and I have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can't see and  we not work through that situation and come up with  a strategy for notches that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever  tell me about the last time you got  can I feel really happy  Zoe Sierra go  no that's not true it was when I  saw my biological mother which was last May  my best qualities  I'm very strong  very strong-willed  I  very supportive and loving and nurturing I'm easy to be around I'm intelligence  and  is there anything you regret  I don't think so  now  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don't take life too seriously  how ideal weekend, spend some time at the beach and spend some time with friends  either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to  a club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together maybe go dancing after and Sundays I usually go to  and then I have brunch with friends and  may I go home and Sunday night and get ready for the next day so  I am most proud of  a few things that mean I've moved to places that I wanted to move to and so I've done things that have really spoken to me and if meant something been dear to my heart to actually  achieve those those  goals are those  yeah I've done things that I wanted to do like move to Ireland and move to California  okay",16
378,okay I'm pleased  are you okay with this yes  pretty good  I grew up in Boston  about 30 years ago  yep  I'm too often maybe once a year sometimes less  oh I love living in that way I don't ever want to live anywhere else  well I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and  that's part of it  a very easy well maybe somebody's at the beginning the first few weeks for it's really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew but after a few weeks it was great  broadcast journalism  well it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was twelve until I went to college with sort of in pursuit of that dream  are you still working in that nope  well it's kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just once I'd done that work I realized that's not really what I wanted to do is to cut throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me didn't make me happy  yep  dream job my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries  well the work itself is not very hard I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer you travel a lot I used to I don't travel so much right now  what do you enjoy about  I love seeing different places and different things like I love going to places that are not like  where I'm from  I love to hear about one of your trips my favorite trip is I went to Australia from my 30th birthday  cuz I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I cross the International Date Line  and I went to this really small place up on the West Coast of Australia called sharks Bay where Native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and I got to be there for a whole weekend just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come in they swim with you and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world  more shy  why that's a good question partly the first thing I think of is cuz I've always been that way but maybe that's an excuse I don't know  I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people  so  I watch TV about this probably not the best alternative but it is something I do and I also walk on the beach cuz I live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax  pretty good  it depends on the situation but most of the time I'm pretty good  I don't think I tend to argue with people I think I just get mad about situations but not at people directly  turn up I feel guilty about anything at the moment  that you wish you would handle differ  not sure I have one at the moment  noise other people's noise makes me really mad I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not consider it their neighbors that that just makes me really mad  yeah  well I'm only want the comes to mind off the top of my head is is when I bought my condo it feel like a really hard decision at the time you know I didn't know that I could do it I didn't wasn't sure if I had the money to do it  so thoughtful like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty easy I sleep pretty well  for the most part good I'm I'm just really worried about money at the moment so that's my biggest so I can't say that I'm like great but it's cuz I'm worried but you know I'm also confident that things are going to work up  have you ever been diagnosed with p  nope  I don't know I can't remember  I mean I don't feel super happy all the time but I don't feel unhappy either sort of like just a even keel  really enjoy  well I got to go to the my friends work at the motion picture Academy so I get to see all the enough Oscar nominated movies  she was there one night so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again so that was very pleasant  nice  how your best friend describe you  I think they would say reliable and  well  and considerate and thoughtful  no I really worked hard on that I think there's lots of things maybe I would do differently but there's nothing that really I regret  well I just think that there are things that  like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret so I don't have a lot of regrets about things  that's a good question don't worry about the small stuff  and save more money  well as soon as you know the normal things like I'd lose more weight than I would  think be a little more Fearless Maybe  be a little more bold  I don't think I have any of those  it's been your ideal weekend  well I'm I'm self-employed so I work all the time so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients that's something I enjoyed  so that would that would be ideal if this point my weekends if I were really busy  how to make your life  that I've really been able to take care of myself and that you know I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do  I've done that and I don't mean I don't have regrets about things there's nothing really that is unfilled undone in my life sure there's plenty of things I still want to do but I feel like I've done what I said I was going to do  yeah that's not so great so it's okay with my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother  I feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live in the east coast and I live in LA and then my sister has two girls so I feel very close to my nieces although we don't talk as much as we used to cook their teenager so  I have other things on their mind  probably my teacher person I've learned my holistic Bodywork from I really like to model my work in my way of being after him the keys are a good role model for me the way he holds his work in the way he lives his life  I'm pretty close we're not you know that's her friends but I do I know that I can call him anytime I need him  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood  you're being with my friends are going out to dinner or  yeah just spending time with my friends  okay  thanks  it works again,1
379,all right  thank you  are you okay with this yes  if you want okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good  I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills which is out in the San Fernando Valley was born there and then I moved to Lomita which is in Los Angeles County about probably around 1993 so I'm going to 23 now so it's about what is 19 years or so I've been living there now  some things that I really like I would have to say you know the beach you know not so much the traffic don't really care for that but definitely you know just kind of like The Nightlife you know just people in general I like conversing with others so  right dip  you travel  yeah actually I do I mean I can't see your shoes but yeah actually I do travel a lot I've been to places like Hawaii been to the Caribbean I've been to see you know just different places like Arizona I've been to Oregon Washington pretty much all over I would say so but usually mainly like why the Caribbean Mexico as well so yep  I think it's just the experience you know I'd like you can't you can kind of experience the culture of different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it's just you know it's it's something new to experience I would say something that you know people haven't seen before so  will it see I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago I was back in December was around Christmas time New Year's so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different Islands we went to let's see I think it was Kawaii went to Oahu Maui you know places like that so  you know I would have to say that you know probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean you know just like I said before the whole experience Factor just seeing you know new different things things that are unique so  actually study journalism right now I'm in my final semester so I'm about to graduate couple months  skip  well you know it's kind of funny cuz you know I started off at a two-year Community College and so you know I was going into my business management something to do with you know I think basically accounting but you know I kind of figured that wasn't for me so I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't I mean you know it probably still be sitting at a desk but you know Lisa journalism I can go on the field and I'll talk to people and you know you know receive information gathering information that sort of deal and then you don't write up stories I just thought it was you I was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so  my dream job I would have to say you know something something and maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting you know I think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine so  tell me about your relationship with you  my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know I lose my parents still like I said I'm 23 years old you know there's certain times when I can be a little bit shaky little bit Rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know I've matured a lot in the last few years so things are getting back up to speed I would say things are things are going pretty well  you know I think it's them somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative the people when I'm relaxed and laid-back other times I kind of it's not so much like I go into my shell but you know it's times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't never met them before so it's one of those things that Kanye kind of got to meet me in the Middle with it because you know I can neither be talked very talkative or a x you know I can be a little bit shy but you know once I once I get the conversation going really talkative then so  hey  I'm you know usually I would listen to music or you know maybe just you know can I go for a drive or you know hang out with my friends you know it just something did just the kind that you know he's he's that cuz you know like I said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just want to relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so  you know I've actually been better with that couple years back unite points were like I pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever and I I mean I would just pretty much get angry you know the littlest things everything would just kind of ticked me off but you know I've definitely learned to you no control that sort of thing and you know it may be a better person because of it  well let's see I'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe I can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it but you eventually we make up and I apologize for it because you know I accept that you know I'm wrong and you know certain circumstances  when you feel guilty about  something that I feel guilty about probably you know not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past you know I mean that is the past and you know I don't like this wall in that sort of thing but I think that's one thing that I tried to work on but it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing just being just being nice  Precision I ever had to make a pretty recent kind of tough because I actually have a buddy he was in the Air Force and you recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not really all there anymore like we used to be so it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that but at the same time I don't know is Tennessee's you could be a little crazy so  probably like me on some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so I don't know but yeah  yeah it's pretty tough and I cuz we go way back been best friends with them since I was about five six years old so it's just it's just really hard to deal with but you know I try to I don't I don't you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there I don't ever forget so  your best friend  my best friend  well you probably say that you know I'm a pretty pretty down-to-earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know I try to work on that to you probably say that I'm pretty funny I like to hang out you know just kind of do things here and there you know I'm just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watching movies and I'll grab a few beers I started deal so  yeah it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if I'm really tired and you know I'll probably have a very good sleep I've been sleeping all that great the last few days cuz you know my house there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new Roofing so that's kind of tough that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part usually get pretty good sleep  feeling lately lately I feel pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up I actually got an internship about a month ago for you know my field of Journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so I'm looking forward to that I'm starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and yeah things are just going pretty well right now I can't complain  yeah it's it's not bad you know like I said it could always be worse right but you know I'm enjoying life so that's the that's the best part  I've not know  nope  last time I felt really happy man you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had a sanity I guess you could say I came back to visit from the Air Force you get some leave so you know you're just hanging out no just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that was nice but I miss that you know so  I feel great do you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend and you can have conversation you know 24/7 about anyting you tell anything to him in confidence and you can tell me anything in confidence is like it's hard to find especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so  is there any regret  yeah there there's a probably one or two things that I regret well I mean I got a DUI about three or four years ago actually was four years ago that's something that I definitely regret because you know I look back on it and you know things might have been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions no circumstances that took place so you know I may end up in you. I guess I think I better off for it but at the same time you know it's always going to be in the back of my mind like I said it's just one of those things you have to do within your own way  advice would you give yourself  well you know it's one of those things like I was a child then so I really don't know what to say I mean even if I would have listened then who knows but you know I probably would have told myself you know just be careful you don't make sure you can be the best person you possibly can candy basically you know just always be nice be honest just be caring for others so  probably going back to my buddy with the whole paranoid schizophrenic thing I don't say that I wish I could erase it I just wish that it didn't happen like that so  send your ideal weekend my dear weekend I usually keep it pretty pretty generic I going to hang out with my friends either you know we hang out in the day no do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies now just the standard stuff that people do if so  what are some things you wish you could change about you  some things that I wish I could change  probably just you know be nicer like I said before baby not being as lazy have more determination I mean I I have quite a bit of determination I know what I want to do with my life but I know there were times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical and so I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate is much so  well you know it's it's tough to think back but I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad as you know I would say probably like when I was kind of getting angry at certain people maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have I'll try to give him more constructive criticism but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of characters  okay  the best qualities I would say that I'm definitely hardworking I'm determined a very caring now More Than I Used to Be  very honest and you know I just I love to talk to people like I like making new relationships I like making people laugh  something that I did recently that I really enjoyed you know it's probably over at my internship I was just going to write a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done eventually they're going to go into the paper so I feel accomplished about that you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you don't like I did that so makes me feel good  you know just let's see a few different stories that just usually things about will the papers in Long Beach so it's usually about you know stories are events that are taking place in Long Beach so  I would say that I'm most proud of you know graduating high school. Graduate college hopefully you know I was going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job you know the near future I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of  thank you  so we value your feedback so  after you take care with your answer,2
380,that I am  alright thank you so much Rachel  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in his face  I'm not a  are you okay with  sure  I'm fine I'm doing all right  yeah  from Maryland  yeah the Maryland Washington DC area  I like 5 weeks ago  Maryland  it's a lot it's a lot less  it's at. It's not as nice this time of year it's more  it's it's good it's nice it's always a lot better though it's a lot it's a lot more people a lot more going on  I'm still I guess I'm still getting used to it so  it's  it's not like  yeah I'm still getting used to it it's coming slowly but but surely  I live in Culver City  I do I have one  it's okay it's I live in a really nasty house it's me it's cheap it's cheap cuz I'm living in a friend's place  and  but but if he's letting me stay there for half price but the at the actual like Place itself is pretty horrible living conditions but I'm moving inside  I can't see your shoes actually  but no I I travel meet us at met by probably traveled more than most people in the US like considering that most people don't travel in the US but I wouldn't I wouldn't call myself a world Traveler  I enjoy the chance to get to like see other walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the  the specificity of my own you know the the the given the parameters that I grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally I mean even just within the US like seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like Thailand or something growing up it's pretty pretty amazing  okay  put me on the spot here Ali  let's say  well I  it's been awhile since I've been on a trip I guess one of the last trips I did was to  I made a lot like two years ago I went on a road trip across the u.s. and that was that was pretty amazing saw but I guess the best put the best two places on the drive from Maryland to LA this is before I actually moved out here but I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the us it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so unique the culture they are so unique and and the blend of like Caribbean in French and all these other influences into like the American South is so so yeah it's just it's it's unreal  tough question  what  can you come back to that question are you capable of that  come back to it  yeah so just that  dumb  you know that's actually a question I've been asking myself I knew I know my entire life I've had like phases of Interest so when I was like very very very young I was really into like the first phase that I remember was keys and then tools like a girl around collecting keys and then I go around collecting tools like just every sort why the toolbox my parents have told me that I had faced before that with his balls like various balls and then I was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and instead like animals and then the dinosaur phase and at a certain point I got really into like rat like music like the first rap and then guitar and then acting and then it's some point in their I I I remember telling someone that right now I'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually I was going to be interested in in  film think I could kind of see the trajectory coming but I don't remember what led me to that conclusion I think I just always I would love to sheltered life as far as movies are concerned I didn't my parents didn't let me see an R-rated movie until I was like in high school of us like and and I never signed a lease on R-rated movie I was also very squeamish like I remember when I was fairly young maybe like 6 I saw Star Wars the first seen a Dark Star Wars Darth Vader cracked like brakes a guy's neck at just a little scene bear at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and I had to leave the room so  I'm not really sure  yeah it's it's it's I'm not exactly sure how I got into film but I've always been fascinated by like how people interact in what like you know acting and stuff something movies in general  I am yes  to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and put together and like I cuz I don't use that word so much cuz I think I think of it more as like I want the opportunity to put together and make movies or to make movies is probably the best way to do it to say it cuz I want you and I want involvement in all the all the processes but  I guess the best Parable for that would be a director directing  well it's a lot better when I'm not living with them my  I guess  it's funny you should ask Ellie thinking about it a lot lately I think I'm close in my entire family on closest with my dad I get along with my brother and sister you know like but I don't  went away like my brothers in a foreign country right now so I don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like I spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else cuz I feel like he's the most like  of all my family he's the one who most except me in like things positively about me I have like a  a complicated relationship with my parents I met on my family and general  you can put yourself more shy  well on the Myers-Briggs personality test I'm I'm an extrovert but like since moving but I'm not like  I'm not I probably we consider myself on the scheme of extraversion are on the scale of extraversion sorry I would consider myself extremely introverted  I just I see other extroverts in just a matter who they're around there a little like strike up conversations in a fairly shy person them sort of like or inhibited person maybe  so I like to like  until  yeah but I'm working on it I'm working on it  what I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  what are you doing  well in the past I would smoke weed but I quit smoking weed so now I do not have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie I don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an ant if it's if it's a worn-out sort of stress like I like then I that's what I do but if it's more like anxious type stress I might go on an intense walk don't really exercise that much but I like in a competitive Sports and hiking  pretty good  well I always like arguing  I wouldn't call arguing this to losing my temper  I enjoy a vicious debate but I don't  as long as my like cuz I won't like revert to personal you know attacks in my in my arguments I try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best I can which can get frustrating cuz I'm not like the best articulator of what I think one of my weekly points I would say  but I but the last time I had a heated debate I think that was not the question  when is the last time that happened what happened I forgot I forgot to mention that that I had a heated debate  last time I had a heated debate  was had a heated debate about the movie Boogie Nights I didn't lose my temper exactly but I like very extremely passionate about about that I don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who I was I was arguing with her saying that it was like one of the like best best movies why did they think it was the best movies  they think that like there's something there's some sort of as I understand it they have  they have a certain they think that the  take all of the stories with in Boogie Nights they have their own like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole lake complexity of character within the movie and  but somehow like  what were they saying they were saying like the movie  it's like it's like the end of an era which makes it look kind of like casino and there's this attention to detail of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot kind of like  yeah I guess I think the heated debate became about like that so from there and like personally it's not like a bad mood or anything but it's the I just don't think Dirk Diggler is like that like me meaning full of a character like I like it the way I come out I came out of the movie cuz I had seen it before many years ago night at my opinion of it is basically the same even though like I remember it like in watching it again I was able to re-evaluate it there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing I like articulable about that sleeps has a good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool that you know it's cool it's but but it's meat for me it was like meaningless and then two and then they were that let us to discuss the movie that I recently that I really did like his Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was the Sixth Street I get the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the mood  Django Unchained you have Django and jango's like it kind of has a two dimensional character but I don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and you have dr. King Schultz who's this who's this like his mentor character and the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would have risked his life to save Django or like would have gone into this like second act where they go and they go to the plantation to deceive Django's wife excetera and and the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not  sacrificed himself for someone else which straight which strikes me as so like  like who like she's her bit her basic argument was that like altruism doesn't it cuz it was too. I even ran type of argument altruism doesn't exist the only the only thing you can do is sit like the only thing people do is serve them self so it's not quite Iron Man but it's like the only thing that people like old people are out to serve himself which I'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism in and something like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in an in like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate  hurt like if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so let it to an extremely passionate debate and somewhat like yeah it is said that  so so yeah that that I guess that's the I don't think I necessarily like lost my temper I think I'm losing my temper is being more  like I just I would  revert to ad hominem like attacks but I didn't like that's not maybe I was like maybe I was criticizing her worldview but I wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort yeah I'm glad you understand  an event or I don't know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like to remember feelings and moments not stories like my life doesn't always think together until like a coherent story it's like this moment in that moment in this moment in that moment yeah  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  the hardest decision I've ever had to make  ouchies  could it just be one of the hardest decisions  choosing between two things that it's like  I guess I'm having a hard time recalling a moment where I like had to choose between  two options like no there's no like Sophie's Choice type moment in my life  but I but I do think that the decision cuz I lived in New York for a while I went to school in New York and the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was it was very very difficult  and but I had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all my core group of friends were either likely were Muslim we're leaving and going other places in the world and then the one other person or as close to it was living with someone who I did not get along with it all so it's like the situation where I didn't lose either going to live with people who I wasn't his clothes with or Craigslist or or move home and I think it was a tough decision to to leave that the only way I could do it I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York with in like a month or two which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that I could leave New York  you was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that  it was it was just a very like isolating ice is also like I'd felt like previously to that time I'd fallen in love with one of my closest another one of my close very close friends and  that had kind of gone extremely  badly and so I wasn't on speaking terms with her and I couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like closer to her her it was quite like her me type thing but that that was the way that I kind of  saw it at the time so I didn't like you know just being socially isolated  yeah  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep was recently it's been awful  I like to eat so the last last night I slept for like 10 and a half hours which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night  so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that I got four hours in 2 hours of sleep cuz I was working on sat and I would get back and either and I just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's  too much Roundup energy or something I don't know  tired very  not immediately I just initially upon waking up like I really enjoy being up in the early morning  and I also stopped drinking caffeine like I've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days I hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so  I guess with with caffeine in my system I'm ready to I'm ready to go without caffeine it's I'm just I'm just quieter I guess  more introverted  since Lake lately is in Latin  changing my thoughts yeah I mean I guess when having just moved here and there is a. Of time like at the beginning where the  the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people. They moved here cuz I have a group of friends here or couple of friends I don't have like a large number friends and the the push 2  to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first and I think that I'm slowly like  coming to terms with that  and moving in a moving past it at but not like it's still it's still there the pressures there but I'm just you know  you know you know you know  no I just  nope  the last time I felt really happy  might have to reach back  I think the last time I felt really happy  was during the writing process of salt last year I shot a movie co-wrote co-directed co-produced  and that was kind of like that it still consumes my life but I think that during the  writing stages of that movie in which we would like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative  energy between me and the person riding it in  and there is like probably like a good day that I remember where it's just I remember going to bed and I was just so thrilled to be working on when I was working on and and and working with the person I was working with and like  just like  I felt like it yeah I guess that was the the last time that was that was like more than a year ago though but I guess it's hard it's hard to think that I haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy especially if you're doing it basically by yourself with with like kind of like you can't too much else to do  I would say that I'm very  except like accepting of other people and always very empathic  and  open like  excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and  yeah  I guess I wish I was last  less ruled by fear more more Fearless in my you know  everyday in our actions and in my like  you know  zest for for living  yeah I  I got other things I would change about myself I would I would  I don't know  really badly about myself  I Need A Renewed numerous instances in my childhood in which my like like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of  some sort of  conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always  always on the other side of the Court you know like never it was I noticed  or noticed as I got older that other people other parents were like at their kid was in trouble like there's something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite in particular my mom sorry it said that there are a couple of instances in which  I was like blamed her like you know  it was my was my fault when  when what I was doing it like  Yeah Yeahs think things things that I couldn't like  no yeah I don't know  yeah  10 years ago  stay steak unit like I I think that there is  I have a tendency to  like I'd love to love the fact that I have a tendency to get really caught up in ID in an idea in like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes  ideas are too easily decided to say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you  are only going to do one thing try to like I guess I would have taken up like some taking piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums would have been drums more than reading music I would say I'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes  as far as like cuz I was always really into directing so he's directing actors and stuff but I didn't it's only now that I I don't know I guess  stay  Don't Stay Stay Stay yeah I don't know that's a tough tough tough question la  that's it  sure  goodbye  but  all right  experience with Ellie,10
381,okay thanks  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  I was created to talk to people and it's safe  are you okay  yes  okay  from Santa Monica  other people mostly  all the people all suck  I know not a lot  I can't afford to travel as much as I'd like to  I was an English major  I just like reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study  no not anymore  I love my job you could only say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job  it's my dream job would be to manage a soccer club  always be pretty much impossible for me  I don't have any experience in that field  very shy  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  I play music  what I do when I'm annoyed I don't know  I do what I'm annoyed  I can't think of anything I don't know  I don't think I don't do anything specifically  I pretty good I would say very good I don't lose my temper very often  I was the last time I argued with someone  I can't remember  I don't have a lot of conflicts with people I can't remember the last time I argued with someone  well it see when I was  a little kid  I was outside my grandparents restaurant and there was a robbery and I saw it I what I saw it when when the robbers were leaving  that maybe I would want to erase it from my memory if I could  well I didn't know what was happening in that moment so I didn't feel so bad at the time but I felt bad afterward because then  you're my mother was upset by my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturb that way but at the time it actually happened I wasn't really upset was more the aftermath of it  consideration that  I don't know  all I can think about this probably a million situations that I would have I would say I would have handled differently I can't think of one in particular  Maybe  I think that when I was a kid  well I think that when I was at sea  well I have okay have a good one  I didn't marry the girl that I think that I should have married so that's a big one for me  yeah well we were together for about 4 years  and I think I just took her for granted when I just didn't commit  and them  that was a long time ago and now that it's been so many years I realized well I don't know they fight the realization but I think now that  that yes she should have been my wife that we were meant for each other are made for each other  but because my selfishness and because I just  I have this fear of commitment at the time I just felt like I didn't  they didn't do what I should have done with with a smart thing would have been  what's something you feel guilty about  well the last thing I can think of that I would say I feel guilty about was  now I feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships I'm not I don't feel like I'm as good of a friend as I could be but then at the same time I don't really know exactly what the  how I could be a better friend I just feel a little guilty that I'm not that I can't help people anyone who has a problem I can't I never feel like I can help anyone  who I know who has a problem so  how that happens every day I guess if that happens with everyone who I know and everyone  all of my relatives and all of my friends I don't feel like I can really give them anything or help them in their lives  tell me about your relationship with your  well there  it's very distant it's it's just it's very cordial and it's very  I don't know what the word is it's hot it's kept it a very surface-level I don't think that they know I don't think that my family really knows me very well at all  and I don't know them very well either not nothing to hide in a true sense  so  yeah it's  I think a lot of families are that way but it is it does bother me that mine is that way  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep so it's very easy I sleep a lot and I  yeah I have no problem sleeping at all  no not really I would say  the way I'm now it's the way I think I've been my whole life so  you didn't when I was a little kid I slept a lot also and no I don't think I've changed much  I'm pretty down but like I said  in a way I could tell you how I'm feeling really down but then again I've always been this way so it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently that way  yes  I would long time ago I was about 10 years old  around there about  I was just missing a lot of school I didn't want to go to school so we eventually they sent me to  to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and  I want from there  you still go to therapy now no I haven't gone to therapy since I was a teenager  why did you stop  well I didn't feel it was helping me at all so one day I just  decided I didn't want to go anymore  affected you  well like I said it I didn't feel that it helped me  so I guess it's not enough that it affected me much  no I wouldn't say disturbing no  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  well I feel pretty happy whenever I see my nephew  and I have a  my best friend's children are I feel like their mind my nephew and my niece and I'm pretty happy when I'm around them  that's great  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  my ideal weekend would be  I would probably be traveling I would  really enjoyed getting out of the city every weekend  it going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city  I just seen the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go I really do think people are different when you go to different places and  how they interact with you and how they see the world different food  and I also like historical places I mean to history and I and I enjoy this visiting anywhere that has some sort of  historical significance  awesome  I haven't taken a trip in a long time  the last trip I really took was I went to France a few years ago for a wedding  and I had a really good time there I had always wanted to go to Paris and so I got to go to Paris and then I went to a little town  what's a few hours away from Paris where the actual wedding was  I knew it was really fun I think that the church where the wedding was was like a thousand years old so  that was a really cool trip  I got to know I don't have it I don't know what's what would would be considered memorable  a memorable experience  probably the most memorable experience I guess which is be  nothing in particular but but living with the girl who I just who I told you earlier that I think now that we should have gotten married  that's something that stays in my memory that's why I'm saying it's memorable because  it's it's still with me in the  it's something that I don't think you know what I know I'll never forget but it's not any particular day or any particular moment  a lot  check it be healthier  for one thing and more energetic  and the more friendly I think I am pretty friendly  but more more outgoing more more more social  those two things mainly I guess that I would like to be more and more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier  that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me I think  I think he would say that I am  a very cheesy but probably say that I'm a very spiritual person  and that I'm very giving I think I'm a lot more selfish than people think I am but people think that I'm not selfish  and probably he would say there in Creative also  put my advice to to myself I don't understand the question  is there anything you regret  yeah but we already talked about it  no I can't. I don't think I really believed in and being proud or in the end Pride  I don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but I can't really think of  any accomplishments  anyway even if I did have something to be proud of. I can't think of any any sort of accomplishment I've had  something I did recently that I really enjoyed  well I signed karaoke with a couple of friends of mine  I don't usually do that but  yeah that was a lot of fun a few days ago  thank you  I was more difficult than I thought it was going to be just kind of had me stumped a lot and a lot of the time and I was  I think I got better after a little while and I was  at first I thought I was going to get mad because I'm not saying anything and I don't know how to answer and,16
382,trigger job on that  all right  okay KO  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  are you okay  sure  I'm doing fine  I'm from Columbia South Carolina  yep  2004  once a year for Christmas break  a lot slower paced  more  I wanted you to pursue a film degree or I'm sorry I film career  are you still doing that yes  it's pretty challenging but it's fun  I've always had an interest in film and movie so it seemed like a natural fit for me  took about a couple of years  bachata  I feel like I'm pretty used to it now  I liked it doesn't snow it's warm weather and there's lots to do with a lot of beaches  show the traffic and the cost of living is pretty high  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I got much of a  I never been outside of the US but I would love to at some point  you can see yourself more shy  depends on the situation I can either be introverted or extroverted just given the right circumstance  okay  sometimes when I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  I know it's not polite but it's the best I've got  what are you doing  I like listening to music doing crossword puzzles reading and hanging out with friends on weekends  very good  I don't think it was an argument maybe about difference of opinion so is more like a debate but it was pretty pretty tame  I think it was a debate over Sports of a basketball game  and I was talking on Facebook with somebody about it  but I think it's good to express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's it's natural to you know not always agree on things so I think talking about it is healthy  I have a very good relationship with my family I get along with all of my family members and extended no cousins and aunts and uncles so there's no one that I have ever had any risks with  with my family  I probably could have been more disciplined growing up and more  more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kind of thing  but for the most part I had a I had a good childhood and there's not much I would change about it  okay  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had  probably leaving my comfort zone and South Carolina moving out here that was pretty hard but at the same time it was exciting so it was it was a Bittersweet feeling  a lot of excitement mixed with some anxiety but it went away pretty quickly  sure  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  not doing better in school when I was in high school  you've done anything to avoid it  I definitely I could have been more diligent worker I could have applied myself a little bit better  I've always had a strong family support system  and our parents and siblings so  that's definitely a positive thing  tell me about new bed or  event  probably going back to school I wish I would have  wish I would have done better in school so I could take something back from my past it would be scholastically related  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it's pretty easy  I don't sleep well  I tend to be kind of lackadaisical and just tired throughout the day kind of groggy  okay  have you noticed any changes in your butt  I know everything's pretty much the way it usually is with me  how did the feeling lately I'm feeling pretty good  I know I have not  I know I haven't  first time I felt really happy  I made a lot of money a few weeks ago and I feel like I'm ahead of the game with you know what having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so I'm still kind of have the lingering effects for not happiness  yeah  when I  when I have money I tend to be a lot more even-tempered not even tempered but I tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and the city being such a about your finances if it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game and to have  dish have sources of income  I think I'm creative  and I think I'm a good listener  to be as disciplined and focused as possible  because once you're out of your parents homes and out of their lives you have to depend on yourself in the better the better you do in school in the better you are  as far as discipline concerned the more pleasure pleasurable your life will be in a lot your life will be a lot easier  let's see here  I wish I was more  disciplined but I'm working on that and I've gotten a lot better at that  it's become pretty easy I think I'm just getting older I'm I'm out of my twenties now so I definitely seeing a change from when I first came out here  tell me about  some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kind of made me feel bad but I kind of take insults and stride and sometimes that welcome constructive criticism because something is wrong with either you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited it's coming from the right place I think it could be an invaluable tool you listening to what other people have to say that might be negative  probably optimistic and  outgoing optimistic and  helpful  find your ideal week  my ideal weekend I would love to go to Vegas and have a road trip with what three or four friends in a packed in the car and just lots of disposable income and you know good weather  when is the last time that happened  I haven't been to Vegas and probably 5 years but  I've gone to casinos with my brother and it's pretty fun sometimes  I'm proud that I've come a long way from when I first moved out here I'm a lot more disciplined I read a lot I do crosswords and I think I've  I think I know it's important life now and I'm more focused and going after what I want  I'm not a big fan of high taxes  but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and  I guess I take it in stride though  I had a friend over at my apartment and I watch the movie now it's fun  it was a documentary  SI Sports  sure  goodbye  alrighty  cool  it's funny I would say something,0
383,"it's kind of fun this weekend  okay  cool thank you  and please  are you okay with  yeah I'm totally fine it be confidential or not you know my words everybody's get wild  I'm doing pretty good hanging out nice weather I just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you the digital you that I'm saying I don't know if it's yeah it's funny  because I'm just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings  do you like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself  yeah  I think you see what I mean I'm from born and raised in Los Angeles Venice area marvista specifically that's where I'm from  well  a lot more that I don't like but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up  that's the idea of certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent in a topic very thought upon and I feel that Los Angeles is deep culture is why I stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to that's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand yeah  well the  the human mentality here is  is very is very hectic very chaotic in a lot due to the vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that were on a grind you know this yeah it's it's a very it's very hectic atmosphere human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting Living Community to help each other out kind of thing  well I can't see your shoes but I love to travel I do love hiking I do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides I do love to travel you  I'm from my travels it's not like well I do enjoy a lot of things about travel but it's more like what do I it's it's just more like I enjoy not being trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this photo image in a man-made image that it is here so I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is  thanks  would you  okay well I am  kind of recently last year went to Los Banos Central California area and although it wasn't that far from LA it was completely different energy out there is no phones there's no Wi-fi there's no TV there was there was sanity there was a Relative Insanity in the sense that people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people are just real real and hiking and chilling I was working in a Hot Spring Resort  and I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry  I'm not hard you don't you don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't  I guess  kind of what I described about the city I just wanted to get out of here and  kind of just get out of here really and just experienced the real the real deal  I'm well  currently I'm studying  currently I'm studying Physical Therapy I'm about to become licensed massage therapist but before that yeah it kind of cool but before that I was going to  I'm for music composition so I was just writing scores for films animations dance Productions theater Productions stuff like that trippie trippie it is cool but I had to leave that because tuition hikes up to you now going up to like 50 thousand a year for like a four-year BF not not the deal not trying to trap myself with these chains of Federal loans  so yeah  hey that's not a good word sex  dream job  my dream job would be  anyting  that I can do to alleviate these Metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to incite dream back within the modern human worlds and within a physical therapy and artistic expression I've got some  great ideas yeah  I guess my ago and I just like I just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah  I thought that was really funny what I do to relax is  can I Breathe It Out chill maybe make it smoothie or some tea I'm going to go bike riding rides  pretty good I guess I haven't yelled in a long time  when was the  what wasn't arguing I don't I don't really argue much I just like to save my opinion and have it be understood and I like the person I'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was  I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from New York and we're talking about riding and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written  yeah so yesterday  Kelty  stuff I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt what about you what something you feel guilty about  okay  I don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory cuz then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased hang a butterfly effect, like yeah  maybe the time  I'm sure she was going to school I was taking the year off and I was just kind of hanging around but we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out  you know not all nothing turns out as it start to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little  a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny but yet ended up on me leaving before the lease ended and I'd actually ended up here with the separating but that's something I wish maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully  the hardest decision  maybe maybe not hard disk but a hard decision to make was leaving school dropping my continuation of achieving a BFA  yeah that could have been the hardest  Chester I don't  I mean of course money money is the motto money is a big issue tuition hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fast not a fan of support that but  yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition ax going around and  but another reason why I  decided to leave at to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because the Art Institute you know that's it the funny idea and itself already and basically I was a musician  being taught by a musician  to make music and same with you know all that of the dancers or the theater students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know and it's just  yeah it's just not quite as artistic as I thought art would be our art comes from somewhere summersweet and deepen purple and not not from out there he knows so yeah  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  if I  if I am  it's kind of easy I mean it depends you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or fi  remember to breathe and go through my Montresor  remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into a real nice but if I just get diluted with all my thought that it takes a long time until I remember to breathe yeah  I'm yeah basically just what I said just breathing or you know if I'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if I get the lucky chance to be medicated from you know a nice and I send a car then it really does you know it Indica does put me down pretty nice pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know in a medical herbs like chamomile and cannabis and  just a going believe in myself of bad bad juju  I guess not if I can't think of something now  I've been feeling  kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a gray line but it's a nice grey it's really nice hue  some people wouldn't like this but I really like that and it says it's stable  that sits comfortable yeah  no no I haven't  not by a certified medical professional now but now I haven't  can you tell me about  yeah I mean I just think like the whole you know like you said PTSD depression and you know other in a mental instabilities I think everybody is depressed I think everybody is Overjoyed I think everybody's angry and everybody shy everybody social all at the same time you know it's just different days different you know variance different floats different boats you know different waves different swells so yeah I think  I'm depressed I think I'm really happy I think I'm really angry I think I'm really friendly you know all that but just on different very different floats  really happy  I am going to feel really happy a lot and I feel really sad a lot but really happy was yes maybe this morning when I was just biking over here enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze biking  yeah it is  well a lot of best friends and they prescribed me all pretty differently but underlying that same idea and maybe I'm just maybe in a nutshell just kind of Aquarius and I guess  okay  advice would you give yourself  well I'm 21 so 20 years ago I would have told myself to keep being a baby stay young  and don't lose sight you know don't stop listening keep letting things happen don't make them happen b b a beautiful baby that's what I would have told myself yeah be a beautiful baby  my cat's recently what has been shown to me through Me By Me is my ability to work with others in a manner of speaking in artistic standpoint I've been collaborating a lot with artists working on a lot of different mediums mixed-media projects and  I'm really comfortable with it and with other people's and melting are ideas together yeah  what are you most proud of in your life  that's a weird question like  like that's trying to make me single out  the Inn on one moment that I today reflect upon and think about like it's some past Glory that I'm not capable for feeling today so I think the proudest moment of my life is right now chilling thing in with you  thank you yeah thank you  it's interesting my immediate family is

386,"might have pulled something that  I'm going to bring the great thanks so much  and please  are you okay with this yes  oh I'm fine I'm a little tired but I found out my thyroid is I think acting up so  where are you from originally I was born in Canada  but I've lived in California most of my life so and it's gray today too so the gray weather makes you kind of see no sluggish  oh my gosh years and years ago  not at all I don't think I can text to her for a long time well the air fares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost-prohibitive so  oh that's see everything has plus and minuses cold-weather not as much sun so I think I'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm-weather so but other than that it's it's very pretty back their natural scenery in but I like it here you know the traffic is kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with  why did I move to LA because my family came here and started to my dad got a job here and thus became our home base and  that's why  easy very easy sew  well in high school you generally study General Ed they have designated courses and then after that went to college and I was a business major let's say I was a Veterinary major and I graduated with a degree in Liberal Arts so  I don't know can't really pinpoint  I was working in Social Services but I've also worked in sales and most recently I'm doing real estate, leasing consultant part-time  I mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not I don't really see too many negatives  oh probably to work as a gossip columnist it TMZ or one of those networks but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with cats you know animals  so  I'm very outgoing in fact I think I'm so echoing I scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know Reserve people out there so I'm kind of East Coast very you know I go up to people and talk to them first social  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  oh my gosh there's I could do hundreds of things I could read I could watch a show turn on the music music is great take a walk call my friends  million things so  I'm pretty good I'm very good I mean you know of course when you're driving in LA and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes I can be irritating but I'm I'm actually pretty I'm not the type of person that will fighter jet I don't like to have confrontations so  I can't really remember so that's why I said there's not very many arguments usually I avoid arguments at any cost so  do you feel guilty about  I don't really feel guilty about anything right now or that I can think of  I can't think of anything right now  I really can't think of any decisions that were really hard I mean most of it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so I don't have a family so if I have to you know I had to moves to San Francisco for a job once but since I'm single it's I don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so kind of makes certain things easier when you don't have other family to consider  yeah  in advance  well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so I know when my father died you know I mean I wish I would have had him for a lot longer and he died at the age of 77 and you know what have been nice to have him around a little bit more  but you know I can't control those things life has its own way of dealing with that  yes there are Yin and Yang that's ancient philosophy and it really applies here is pluses and minuses the negatives and positives so  well like I said my dad's no longer here and my mother and I you know we have our differences I think mothers and daughters always do my brother and I get along great I see him a lot my sister works a lot I see her and you know we talked and she's kind of got her own life and her children I get along great with them so  we have a small family  once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids up there I think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved I mean you know there's always going to be children that are cut out of control but I don't know the ones that I've seen recently the very well behaved so can't say much else about that  well I live in an apartment and I don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but there's someone that lives above me I'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of I guess they have lots of energy they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes I'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall so it sounds like Niagara Falls and they are and so I don't ya and I need 8 hours of sleep and I've only been getting oh I'd say like maybe 6 hours and then I usually wake up once at night take a sometimes they'll kind of around 2 or 3 in the morning go either walk around or I'll hear something so I'm not getting a straight 8 hours of sleep and it's definitely but there's not like I said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know I means that the ladies look very quiet it  just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers question close at night that's I can't say anything to her about that  yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so I don't make a lot out of it you know and I just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so you know I have to consider sleeping in another room but for now you know that's I'll deal with it so  tired very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done cuz I don't have my energy also I haven't been exercising I normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kind of colder and kind of dreary or so you know I'm not as motivated when the weather is kind of blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise not getting 8 hours sleep  how you been feeling lately  as I said before tire has a combination of the weather you know I'm here in Los Angeles right now we have been having very gray days I live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so I'm not getting my serotonin I need that I am I getting my 8 hours of sleep because you know whatever and I think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know I have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the Sun comes out I'm kind of more energetic it just gives you that more energy  have you ever been diagnosed with p  no  no  I hope I'm happy most of the time I'm a pretty happy person and I like to be around other people I mean of course I like my private time but I do like being around people quite a bit so  can't think of anything right now I mean I usually enjoy everything I do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else  okay  is there anything you regret know I never regret anything  what advice would I have given well I guess yeah I could probably change things around I think it everybody could I probably would have had a different college major in a seems like  what else I probably wouldn't have dated certain waste of time with certain people  I don't know those are them things that come to mind  maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things  but  how your best friend in Spanish  outgoing lots of fun to be with just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend I'm loyal trusting and  I listen I'm a good listener I'm very patient as well so  what are some things you wish you could change about yourself  well I never wanted me to lose weight but I think that's a worldwide problem I mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and especially here in America a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we  you know it's just easy to real it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so that's the way that you know house gives you more energy to if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing you  I understand  how do your best friend describe you I think you might have asked me that question before her  but if you want I'll repeat it so  I'm very like I said I'm very loyal when I tell people I'm going to do something I do it very reliable I am warm I'm very friendly great listener and I mean I've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like I said I'm very I'm pretty upbeat you know I'm don't let things get me down too much so  how have in your life  that's a hard question that can't think I mean I'm  can't think of the answer that way so  4fun well I love movies so I could see every movie that they make I love going out with my friends shopping swap meets my gosh and traveling is great road trips  that's kind of  we know part of it yeah that I mentioned so  traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it the foods and joined Foods in different countries the architecture it's just kind of need to get away and see a completely different place  okay well I've been to a lot of places in Europe I love Paris is such a walking City you can whoever designed that City I'll tell you I mean it's you can get from one point to another the Subways are great  each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the Latin quarter where the students are there is another area where let's say the fashion designers are kind of like our Rodeo Drive here in Beverly Hills there's an area that is more African and they have swap meets in the weekends that are wonderful is for international  and then like I said when she get out of Paris there's just so much history you can go see Versailles there's other palaces you can go to the south of France you know  but that's probably my favorite country I've been to Italy as well so  yeah well after college people usually many people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to Europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and you kind of have a more adventuresome Spirit you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases it's not not a big deal so yeah that's  thank you goodbye  oh that was that was fast  but I didn't never said there wasn't any like shocking question  never know I guess",11

392,hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today are you okay with this yes  I'm doing well  California  I like the weather I like the people  I don't like the traffic that's primarily it  sociology  it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects  now  to be a writer  can you tell me about  I like being able to write what I want to write right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in  like what like articles about a teenager culture stuff like that  I think they have it pretty easy and I know how easy they have it  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot at no not really  okay  you can see yourself more shy  depends on the situation or who I'm around when I first meet people I can be shy but if it's someone I've known for a while I can be that guy  I'll lay down or try some shirt like deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun in my numbing like watch TV  I'm pretty good I don't really let anger show that much I'm not like that I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that I'm pretty rational  when was the  I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was cuz it's been so long  what's something you feel guilty about  because I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should  I'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family  cuz they basically serve raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much  I can't really think of one  right now  I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing  yeah yes  is the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband  what made you decide to do that because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but I still felt like I should stick it out  how hard is that  I mean it was hard at the time but I made the right decision I think  my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age  can you tell me about that  she's just a very strong powerful through staunch character that rubbed off on me  so good  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep not really super easy  I sort of I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late  just heard a foggy and distracted and trouble concentrating  okay  how did the feeling lately  you mean like my body  normal fine no complaints  and same as ever  no  last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff  how would your best friend describe  probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring  bunny radio  I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around reading or going to the movies watching TV  is everything your  no I don't think there's that I don't think I think regretting things is a waste of time  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don't try to  don't go out of your way to try and press people if they like you than they like you  what are some things you wish you could change about your  sometimes  sometimes I can be kind of lazy  I'd like to have more of a laxative  better work ethic I guess  it just sort of putting off stuff until you know right when it's due or after its do things like that procrastinating  okay  tell me about a time when someone made  sometimes for the things that I write people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website that'll make me feel bad  I'm articulate and funny and a good friend  I guess I'm most proud of the fact that  I  and satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world  I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it  I'm just hanging out with my friends for people watching watching a movie that's good listening to music,1
393,she's going to ask you some questions  okay  so when she done just get the bunny all right  are you okay with this yes  I'm good  I'm originally from Los Angeles California  I like the weather I like numerous things the women  stuff like that  traffic traffic is ridiculously like it's out of control like the way people drive here  business economics  I just wanted to be a business owner like I wanted to work for myself so that's the reason why I did that  yes I am currently  to be a CEO of a of a company  I shouldn't be that hard but it's going to be challenges challenging give me wrong  I mean sometimes it varies I can be shy at times but then I'm I'm mostly outgoing  sure I mean when it comes to certain things like let's say I go to a club or party and I see a girl I want to talk to you I'll go talk to her but when it comes to being around a lot of people like sometimes I do get a little shy and reserved  I work out  hang out with my friends  that's what I do  I'm pretty good at it. Things get to me  when was the  actually it's been a while I have it are you with anybody I mean I had to like a minor little  little argument about something but that was a few weeks ago and it wasn't something that was serious is just  some things I had to clarify with someone  it was the it was about a girl and I ask you some questions about some stuff basically why she was trying to get back with her ex like that doesn't make any sense to me  I would say my relationship with my brother I wish we wouldn't have fought like we I wish you could have worked it out without fighting each other  tell me about your relationship with your family  my relationship with my family is pretty cool like Mama get along with my mom  and I get along with my sister so it's pretty it's pretty cool  I'm pretty but I'm very close to my family  I would have to say some friends that I met recently I made some people through my church  can you tell me about that  like a mentor to me  I don't know how I don't think I have anything like that in my memory  that I would that I want to race  I would have to say I would have to have been whether or not to  the Sea  as far as like my career path I would say what to where I'm going to get my going to be in and stuff like that  tell me about that  I mean  high school for me went pretty it went okay and I could have done better and basically ended up  not really living up to my potential  I don't know I mean  I really don't know  how is your day  it's pretty easy it's not a problem I can just knock out when I go home at night time  tired  this mainly tired I would say  I've been up I've been fine lately  I have  no  no I have not  no I have not  I would say  it would have to have been  when I when I got the car that I have right now  I have a nice car right now he's pretty fast  awesome  I would say  he would describe me as somebody that's not a quitter somebody that perseveres  no  advice would you give yourself 10  go for whatever I want like when I whatever I want out of life just go for it  don't hesitate  I would have to say Carly my way like I I put on some pounds and I'm working on losing those pounds  tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly  maybe when I was little in school probably  can you tell me more about that  pretty much I got bullied so that's pretty much what happened  I'm intelligent on  hard worker  I'm a good person  I would have to say  having like get-togethers with  with my friends  and  we just hang out with each other in and talk about stuff that's going on in our lives and stuff like that  you're right on time  okay is that it,2
395,so now I'm going to give you the doorbell again when she's done chatting  okay great thanks  and please  are you okay with  yes  I'm doing fine  California here in Los Angeles  I love being near the beach and I love the beach I love living in a big city and I love the fact that I have lots of friends and family here  traffic  just so many sometimes too many people but apart from that I I'm generally happy here  okay  photography and language studies  I love photography I was always interested in it and set it in high school as well so I wanted to continue to learn more about it and with languages I come from a mixed background so I wanted to learn languages of my ethnic background  how hard is that it wasn't hard it was a passion so I enjoyed it  are you still working  I'm not no  to do photography full-time and also to do some of the things that I'm passionate about more creatively more creative things  like what I have an idea I'd like to do make some like a robe Line women's robes and things like that  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I have a travel quite a bit and I didn't I love travel  seeing different cultures different countries meeting new people all about and the language  am I lived in Greece for over a year I taught English there and I moved around to different parts of Greece and really had a great time  I think just having my group of friends that I met there and going through the experience with them I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elephant ethos in a car with everybody and having a just a fantastic time  yes it was  I think I'm shy to begin with and and as I get to know people that I'm much more outgoing  Photography in language studies  I turn on  it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got.  how much is a stay-at-home maybe watch a movie  rest in bed watching a movie in bed that's probably one of the things I like to do to relax  I think very good  it was probably with my boyfriend  regarding money issues  I need to I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now  I'm having some struggles in my career right now and financially it's becoming very difficult  I'm sorry  sounds really hard had two husbands been difficult but I've been working very hard to to remedy that  great  so well I'm here and then I'm doing this this Focus study I'm doing him any things to generate more money working harder but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my my career  probably being raped  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD  no  you have concerning thoughts  sometimes  are they triggered by something  not that I'm aware of  how you been feeling lately  I've been feeling stressed  I've been feeling  been feeling stressed and worried  how easy is it  I don't seem to have any problem with it might seem to get a good night sleep almost every night  I'm grumpy and and lethargic and in the morning  situation I wish I would have handled differently  I really can't think of one right now  the hardest decision I've ever had to make  was probably deciding to not have the child  can you tell me if  well I was pregnant and  wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy and that was also due to financial burden and the father of all was involved with did not want the child so I made that very very difficult decision  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  really really happy  I know when I went to Cancun on a holiday over the new year new year. Near holiday  I felt absolutely fantastic I felt happy I felt relaxed I felt like I didn't have a care in the world to temporarily free  what are some things you wish you could change about you  I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive  definitely more assertive  I would say I'm a wonderful wonderful friend when I left somebody you know I love them very deeply friends family  boyfriend so I think that's good I'm very loyal as a friend I'm honest I care about people I'm fun to be with so I think those are some of my best qualities  my relationship with my family with my father is not so great my parents were divorced when I was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever mostly out so that it's not fantastic but but it's something that I'm used to so it's not as painful as it would be a Patty been there and then I lost him but it's it's still it's still it's still not the best situation I mean I still wish that could be remedied some  there's good and bad relationships in my family  who's some of the positive influence in your life  someone that's been there for me since I was very very young and is always been just incredible when I love her so much  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  10 or 20 years ago I would have told myself to work harder than and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now  a guy regret exactly that I regret I'm not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been it's been much harder  tell me about something you did read  I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy that was probably a great time I'm one of the best times in the last few weeks  and and they're they're great kids  you find it easy to be a parent  no I think they're there it's challenging it is more difficult because their stepchildren so there are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved but we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but  but I but it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it  what are some ways that your  and your pet  I made it make a make a conscious effort not to not to punish them or over punish them I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was scream. I was screaming a lot as a child and it was really it was really difficult so I make sure not to do that  what are you most proud of in your life  I think I'm most proud of the fact that I have been able to travel the world  and live in other places many many other places around the country and around the world and the fact that I learned several languages  and that's what I've been able to maintain really long long long relationships with my friends  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you  goodbye  post survey for you to fill out,7
396,okay thank you  thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people and it stays  are you okay with  yes  okay  Virginia  I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more of diversity  once a year maybe  add song it's a lot slower and there's a lot left to do there  I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and I was a lot more going on  for me it was really easy cuz I wanted some it was very different and I wanted something different  I like I like all the things to do like the Museum's I like the beaches in the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do  people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back in bad drivers  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  not as much as I'd like to I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to you that much  well I like taking I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places my wife and I like to see you  wildlife and Hiking monuments and to seeing different areas  well we  we've got we went to Central California we'd like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to we went to Hearst Castle in the C the C the elephant seals and things like that  I guess  I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary we did the who did the tram in the nice hotel on the jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall  guess somewhere in between  English and film  well I am  was told I needed to go to college in I haven't quite decided what to do yet so I just pick something I like to do for the time being  well wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to I might have done something different like Physical Therapy but  are you still working or not  I know I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before  what made you decide to do that  I needed to not starve and it did it it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and ended up being kind of fun  dream job is to have money and not have to work for it  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  overall pretty gif  I don't remember what about but it probably would have been few weeks ago with my wife  all anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone is not listening it drives me crazy  now if I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me  I don't know I I spent a lot of time on them but I don't I don't know what the hardest one is cuz it if I decide to go with something and you know it's usually for a good reason  what's something you feel guilty about  well I guess I feel guilty about moving to California in that I left my family and Virginia I mean I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there you know I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them  well I mean I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard  I have a good relationship with my  with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's no problems everyone gets along well  very close  mean anything anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise  depends on how much exercise I have get a lot of exercise is pretty easy if I don't it's not  kind of like right now just a little bit  swelling out of it but not really too different otherwise  how do you been feeling lately  I'm just kind of run-down cuz my um my mother-in-law's is dying and we just spent like 3 days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep  just some  just us just slower and more tired and a little more out of it that's all  have you ever been tigers  no  now  usually just when I'm having having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's it's pretty easy for me just getting outside and and and Hiking or exercising not hard for me  I'm not sure maybe I'm maybe like eccentric but in a good way hopefully  is there anything you regret  no  2  be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and two  I don't know just just your normal your normal kind of older kind of wisdom  can you tell me about that  not much just a really everyone realizes things when they get older they wish they had when they were younger  what are some things you wish you can change about yourself  I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back into shape like I used to be at some the biggest thing right now  not much to say just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it cuz it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all  smile like you used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit cuz it hurts too much  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  probably like during that during the day going going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and Wildlife and exercising and then at night you know if we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that  is proud of them proud of moving here and then I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision  my parents my grandparents my wife most people in my life have been  I think I got everything I need,5
397,what's that going to see a psychiatrist cool  okay  IQ  and please do  I'm good but I caught a cold  Ellie born and raised born and raised  it's home food people culture  traffic  a lot of ass  too many was probably  I have in the past I've been traveling lately  the destination I don't enjoy the traveling anymore though I did when I was young but no water it's the destination point  92 in to Spain and my grandma and my father's mother was born in Spain I went back to trace her roots  I spent a week in Madrid a week and Barcelona and a weekend Majorca  had a great time  hydraulic  it was an everyday thing people are friendly finding out some things about my grandmother and her family were interesting  I studied poli-sci and sociology  what's the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do  now now  I have a dream job for a while I was doing sports research for our Native American tribes but I enjoyed it but that's so it's not as  as often as it was mainly because of the the Sports Bureau that exist now that didn't exist when I started  Crystal when I do I still enjoy it  I'll be with it but I'll be with suits me in any given situation  you intend I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  what do you do  listen music  I like oldies Jazz soft music  I've learned it well I have a question I was at Wayne but I've learned to do it well  might want to bug you a super mean words but with my youngest daughter it was about a year-and-a-half ago  can you tell me about  where was stand over an incident I didn't like the way your husband said something to her and it bothered me and when I told her she got it extremely defensive and rather than deal with her when she became she became angry with me  I was mad  three girls 38-37 31  three granddaughters  11-14-18 so I haven't won an argument a long time but I adore all six of them  when I don't really consider myself a parent just wanna grow my baby's 31 and you never lose that but I'm in my parenting at this point in my life I'm enjoying my grandchildren when I was a parent that's a difficult job  getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand I don't understand and that putting your your stuff in front of theirs  hugs  well my dad was with physical and those days you know nobody called Child Services if you got hit  my mother was very loving you but my dad  I adored my mother my dad that was a hard guy but I love him  I never felt abused by him but I mean I'm the one thing I remember you said when you when you're capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house  that's my hope that Skyler the bases of a relationship  okay  my mother  my kids my grandkids  I'm one of them one of the three three sons really didn't have any experience with the females other than with my mother in terms of being the unrelated and my grandma and my first daughter was born I was like why was it so I'm madly in love with her  change my life  that's what happened  when my mother got sick I wish I wasn't there for her the way she should have been  but I don't feel good  oh yeah you can always fix what you do with you  I was just in a real bad situation  but that doesn't excuse the fact that I wasn't there the way I should have been  at least I Did It My Way  why my second marriage probably she she wanted to have children already had my children with my first wife and I had told her initially that I did not want to have children that you know I'm going to head 3 and I was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children  so we got married and then her best friend guy pregnant and our relationship changed and  I basically wouldn't relent and we had to get a divorce  I don't know what I would have had to it would have would have had children with her but I  I wasn't very flexible in the process  what to be flexible  sometimes I am sometimes or no  I've been pulled my boy my father out of off of life support  what made you decide to do that I just keep going back to something he said to me when I was younger that he would come back and haunt me and if I do know if I let him Lay It lay there and suffer  took me a while to convince my other two brothers but that's what we do  can I get erased from my memory  being locked up for a while like erase it from my memory  it's an everyday hell where there's very little Humanity  and you got to do some things that you're not proud of  how easy is it  I've never slept I'm never slept a lot and I'm one of those people that if I wake up I have a hard time going back to sleep so it's best if I'm really tired than you know  what are you  I'm pretty much so with the same oil change  socialite  things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the live incident with my granddaughter Midol youngest daughter but I had a friend recently who was runned over in a crosswalk and then he's on he's on life support Simon feeling too good about that it's it's affected me  was like he was jaywalking and he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the brakes o  and he's on that life support at this point  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or soccer  no not really because that's the thing about me is I'm very inconsistent  no  no  but I've had moments when I thought I was I was depressed okay I was talk to you when you were talking to any other question  yesterday  had a conversation with my 14 year old granddaughter  I'm happy I have moments of Happiness everyday cuz I either speak to text with my daughters and granddaughters everything even if we're upset with one another  I have a lot of regrets  can you give me an  I should have went to law school  that's that's kind of something I thought you were going to think about more in my lifetime it was accepted I just didn't I had other other things I thought I wanted to do  I played with those wanting to be a kicker for football on the football team and had some tryouts things like that but didn't pan out  and that is as that didn't pan out I sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer  we just did other things  I'll take a big that was different I probably would listen to myself  by myself  I could be  if I don't like you I can be very very difficult if I don't like you  I'd very much like to change that  it has in the past year  well I just threw that you can make me feel bad about myself only if I let you and I'm not real big on letting people do that to me on my first wife when when she left me with the children she you know that it was my fault  and I wasn't sure that I believe that but I knew I was an ass and and so I probably believed it and not in its totality but in part  I'm very I'm not judgemental I will listen to anybody but that I agree with you or disagree with you  I've taught myself to  control anger that I that I have  and if if I call you my friend or if I tell you I love you and I mean it that's that's not something that I do  casually  okay why I play 18 holes of golf with it with an old dear friend we got caught up and  4 hours on the golf course 2 hours at dinner  that is your wife have a good time  a lot a lot of memories came in  why am I not like my grandkids I like that you know I like the hell out of them  I don't have all kids in like that I think they're like too much on that rely too much on technology but  but that's me mainly cuz I don't  but if my grandkids are any any sampling of it I think they're good think they're pretty good  I raised my girls  basically by myself with the help of my mother  I think that's the thing I'm most proud of  okay nice chatting with you  already  starting to run with the high school  good memory  head back over to the other,5
399,okay move this I'm gonna move this behind your arm if you don't hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in the states  I'm not a saint  are you okay  yes  pretty good  as far as my parents Ethiopia  yes  the beaches warm weather  the diverse environment  traffic  well I'm currently in school I'm studying African studies  how did you decide  I've always been interested in African studies actually was wanted to help people and I figure that I can help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa making influence  kind of in-between I have my shy moments but then when I'm around a group of people that Angela I'm pretty outgoing  hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the  interacts I normally write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play My Guitar  pretty good I don't really  get angry or anything like that I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing  when was the  I actually can't remember the last time I argue with someone  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  all the people I've hurt in the past  can you tell me about  well I've  like cheated on people  hurt their feelings intentionally  some things I should have done that I regret now  well with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now and I probably shouldn't have argue so much as try to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out  hardest decision I've ever had to make was  man I really don't know actually  having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer  well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it's just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don't want to be there cuz he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just saying I'm stuck in bed and was just terrible  tell me about your relationship with your  me and my family are very close we don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it but we've never had that closed collection connection especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to a racial mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of Step each other each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does it kind of awkward but it's okay  I think they are out of control I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it I feel like they're being applauded by the media there being applauded by celebrities that they follow  and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights I fall asleep like a baby  what are you like when you don't say  usually creative actually when I can't sleep I'll just stay up and I'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up  stuff like that is usually a good thing when I can't sleeps nothing really bad cuz I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that  I'm lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm at a Giants and I'm alive and then some some days where I'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking  not like my life self  I don't know his wife's been like that weighs have those UPS in those downs but they kind of balance each other out  no  the last time I felt really happy was  today  I'm just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day  I went to see you some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers wrote A good essay so pretty accomplished and I feel like my days just a good day  my best friend would describe me as odd most people would describe me as odd  I see a lot of odd things I do odd things I'm interested in things that most people aren't  Just Like Old literature revolutionary stuff  stuff about changing the world but through underground means  no I don't I don't live a life of regret  I never let fear stop you from doing anything  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  I'm reading just hang out with some friends driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure  things you wish you could change about your  I don't wish I could change anything about myself I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be  tell me about a time when someone made me feel really bad  this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people have hurt her the ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all  my parents  can you tell me about  I mean although we don't see eye-to-eye the always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day although I never listen to him or I don't choose to listen to him once it happens I learned from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learn to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do no more than me  I'm not so much anymore I travel around the LA try to find you sights to see but as far as I don't travel outside  I'm discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the Limitless possibilities  I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures  new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself  a few days ago I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert has to offer and it was just enjoyable  I felt free away from all this the city's needs buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time  feel good  I'm most proud that I've always been different that despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird rum otter I think weird things I've always maintained my original mentality  sharing your thoughts with me  all right,7
400,"all right  thank you  are you okay with this  yeah  I'm fine  Pacific Grove California  the wholesale opportunities and all the stores and anything I could ever ask for  the traffic is the mood of the people and the unhealthy pace  I would see I did like culinary and I did really good in art and music  in high school  through my own will and desire to want to get involved with the music  no  open up a health practice of some sort  what made you decide to do that  changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the for the benefit of Health  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes  do you travel  when I have the opportunity  buying things seeing the culture relaxing not thinking about the city  well yeah I used to go to Texas every every year with my dad during the summer and I always wanted to stay there and live there when I went on vacation  most likely one of these trips to Texas where we would go and spend time in the desert shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that  it was  I'll see y  my dad and I are not really talking that much and my mom Dust Away about 2 months ago  I'm sorry to hear that  thanks  definitely Marsh I always been that way  I just a personality that I've grown into but learning how to adjust the sensitivity and grow out of it  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  teen  eating I like to eat that make that calms me down  not that good when I get really upset that it's usually a problem and I have to work to come myself down and sometimes I just don't get on something and I don't stop  sometimes but I've learned to control it to that extent now  when was the last time you  yesterday I was arguing about what's what kind of water we should be drinking  oh well a difference of opinion and I felt as though my opinion was very valid even though the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed  definitely everyday is growing process I wish I would have handled everything differently every day which is what makes me grow and I tried to work toward, it would have wanted to handle things everyday little by little  okay  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  can't think of anyone right now  what's something you feel guilty about  find I'd I'd say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices  I'd rather not get into it  the raw food Educators on YouTube and raw vegan Educators and the detox therapy therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past 2 months  well that they believed that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like T Colin Campbell The China Study the sources of information that are that are very good and I think deserve respect based on you know real research  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep really easy I've almost got it down to a science  what are you like when you don't say  I'm tired  I'm feeling better than I have in a long time  oh yeah I think it's due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that's actually you know losing them talks and some things that I've accumulated over my short lifetime of you know toxic choices with Food and Drugs or whatever it would be  yes I'm less tense and less irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my  decisions in my wants versus what I need that sort of thing  nope  yes to some extent  our 5 years ago  lack of motivation and  basically make my symptoms were paralleling that of depression  loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of social situations and the main for 5  no  I believe I overcome to chapter in my life that was the the doctor you know taking control my health and experimenting with drugs and I just sort of took another route which was alternative and I started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what I needed with help of the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that  yes  can you tell me if  I believe therapy is useful because  without looking inward or having somebody to help you to that it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resume in the subconscious and tell you you know it has an outburst is basically therapy will help an overall health and mental health I believe fairy  last night I made a really great vegan dinner with no meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot of almost converted them  I would say  you know I'm trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar or as you know my body needs something other than that  apple  it's very very hard it's a daily process  tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad  I was handling money for a business partner and they ended up short and I was to blame but it was actually my formula crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change I make the formula so the blame is on me that I may have took money and I automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy my uncertainty to the change of formula  is there anything you regret  no  20 years ago I was two years old 10 years ago is 12 years old I would tell myself to  to start eating raw fruits and vegetables everyday  as calm and  sad maybe smart talented  I really enjoyed going to the Wholesale Food Market in downtown Los Angeles  can you tell me about that  lots of food at great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price is going to a normal supermarket  so I really get a lot of enjoyment of teaching people how to maybe better themselves especially food-wise what they're eating  what are some things that usually put  eating and I'm watching a really good TV show  okay  I'm insightful I cannot I can adjust to people  I don't know I guess I'll skip that question for now  I'm most proud of  that's in my overall situation with where I'm at right now I could have never imagined that I'd be in such a fortunate situation  that's so good to hear  because I want everything I need  sharing your thoughts with me  I think she's done",7
401,where I am  try to see look like someone I know  no problem okay  okay alrighty  hi  are you okay  yes I'm okay  I'm good I'm a little tired but I'm good  Michigan I'm from Michigan  a long time ago  then I laugh  once twice a year  compared to a  cold very cold  because I wanted to pursue my acting career  how did you do  well it wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity it was the options more options  the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy  blesse  besides the weather  I like that  things are more convenient  I like some of the people here  that are actually from home but  yeah and I just I like I like that it's a little late back  that's about it  I don't like the traffic I don't like  the gang violence in certain areas and I don't like  I like  maybe that's that's all I don't like  I don't know you know I like I don't like that it's so far away from home I wish I wish La was kind of Midwest I wish it wasn't so far from home  have a close relationship with my family it's a small immediate family is really small and we're closed my grandmother recently passed saw it some and adjustment right now but I'm close to my family  okay  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  well I can't see your shoes but I do travel often  I do travel yes  I'm getting there I like getting beer once I'm at the wherever I'm going I like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and people  okay I will owe I went to I'm France few years ago well many years ago and a little town called Carcassonne and was very  it was it was actually really fun but very much like a storybook as far as what I expected to seeing what I actually saw like what I remember that I really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there no windows in the buildings but they are the shutters that most places in the United States have inside of Windows they have them outside of the window there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool I like that  I'm borderline sometimes I'm shy sometimes I'm outgoing and depends on who and what the situation is  music I turn on music I walk  through the neighborhoods now  I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm not a hothead at all  oh it was annexed roommate and it was about my loyalty as a friend  can you tell me about the  yeah pretty much gif  I thought that because I wanted my rent what she agreed to pay that I was not being a good friend that I should just let her live for free  that wasn't going to happen  so you know the Loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me so that's a friend I could have kicked her out I didn't  she laughed at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but she could have  could have been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one  I wish I had handled that situation differently and follow my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and gotten my money up front that's what I wish I had done and I just I didn't my mind told me to go along with it  no my my told me to get the money up front but I didn't  so  the hardest decision  I think I have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like  maybe leaving home  leaving home when I was years ago when I was like 18  yeah  I felt like I was abandoning my family that's what I felt  but I'm very encouraged me to go on and live my life  something that I could erase from my memory  probably a friend who I was on  dating I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when I told him my grandmother was ill  how is your day  I'm it's easy if I'm busy all day and I'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so  it's not that easy actually it's not that easy  I have to because I have to  be exhausted  I have to be exhausted  to be exhausted now it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long  irritable  up and down  I've been up and down like sometimes I've  then excited and anxious and on the other side I'm like  what am I doing  I need triggered by something  you're just a nature sister want to make some things happen  some goals  getting certain kind of work and  having a certain amount of income and  just taking care of myself do you know the way I think I should take care of myself just the physical stuff  eating right and everything  yeah I have  can you tell me about  sometimes I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I need to be focused on in the moment and I'm conscious of that him like of all the things that keep popping up in my head why am I thinking about that  I let them happen and then I try to think about other things and FaZe it out pops back up I phase it out  I know  now  when the roommate moved out I was really happy when she finally left  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  I'm probably reading and maybe go I'll go dancing that would be ideal I can go dancing salsa dancing and yeah  what are some things you wish you could change about your  my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it  really badly  I don't know if I have a time to someone has ever made me feel really badly I don't feel bad about much  as courageous  I will be at in a nutshell  in general  I regret not making some different decisions when I was younger as far as moving forward as far as career stuff and relationship things I wish I had done some things earlier in my life that I'm doing now  I'm really going after some of my personal goals and  deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long-term and yeah I wish I had done that earlier  20 years ago I would have given given myself the advice to continue with my schooling beyond what I did and  to be more Discerning in my choices of individuals who I allow in my life  being a part of the family that I'm a part of  thank you  goodbye  I didn't know if it went,9
402,okay great  yeah  how weird  therapist that she talked back oh my gosh wow  and I'll explain after this is over how it all works just like nobody like making her do anything  are you can tell me later okay  okay so what do I do just do what she says  okay  and you said if I don't want to answer I can just I don't want to answer  the wild okay cool thank you okay  are you okay with that  yes  so how are you doing today  okay  Atlanta Georgia  in 2006  never  I don't like it there  it's completely boring and there's very little to do la is preferable I think to most places  because I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida I moved there to be with him and he loves the water but I love the mountains I missed hiking and I love Florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we can both be happy and also have more opportunities in business and  all of the great things that I have to offer  very  easy  there's not much I don't like about la I love La I think it feels magical so many creative different people of all ages shapes sizes colors races the mountains of water  the city all the things that there are to do all of the different people there are to meet I just I love everything about la  no  I'd rather not talk about it  I didn't go to college  I'm still figuring that out  I don't know it may may have something to do with animals I have a dog that I really loved and I never had a dog as an adult I had cats and  I think I'm a late bloomer so I'm working on that whole conversation I don't I really don't want a job I want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run  it depends on the situation but in general I consider myself more Scheib although most people would consider me to be outgoing  sometimes when I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  what do you do  put on classical music music classical music especially stressed and play with my dog  go for a walk  I think I'm really good at controlling my temper  for the most part  before I came here it was just about them  Financial stress  there's probably a lot of examples I think I'd rather move to another question  yeah I'd rather not talk about that either  I'd rather not talk about that  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  not very easy at all  I'm a lot better recently but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time  in the past week I've been feeling a lot better  tell me about that  yes I  the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer as having more trouble with my depression in the winter and having trouble with tolerating cold and so I wasn't doing a lot of the things that I normally do and I also was sick with the flu and in the past week I decided that I was feeling better enough that I needed to kind of get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day and walking my dog everyday and not isolating so much  sing some of my friends more so I was feeling I've been feeling a lot better like I've been making progress and that  in the past week things have taken a more positive turn  no  yes  it's been quite some time of officially it's probably been  I don't know exactly but let's see  maybe more than 15 years ago  I was feeling suicidal  no  because I found a better alternative  I've been there be off and on since I was 18 and I'm tried a variety of methods and then I started working with some neuro-linguistic programming her and that was really the first person that helped me  make permanent changes and I was able to get off my antidepressants as well and even though I struggle with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and I was one of the best things that ever happened  well I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome and I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her of that disease and  that was he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so  once I had my first conversation with him I knew it was the right step for me  I'm so happy  I felt like I was some  I felt that  I found the answer that I've been looking for that I hadn't given up hope  panda  I would like I'm glad 9 that I had been suffering for a long time and I felt that I finally  found  the answer to the  solution that I was looking for I was like  every last thing I ever did in my life or the best decision I ever made  extremely helpful for the first time in a long time  I went to  I went to a music store  because I've been thinking about I'm taking up an instrument I used to play the violin as a child and I've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because I felt it's been extremely depressed and numb  that's how I went to the music store to try out to see what it would feel like to  to handle and the instrument again and see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue  it was awesome  yeah I'd rather not talk about that  well  that's probably a lot but  I'm always working on being more optimistic  it's been challenging it takes time but  I wish I could hear my own  internal voice better  yeah I have regrets sure  value myself more so that I would make better  relationship decisions  my fiance is the most positive  person in my life my My ultimate supporter  tell me about  I think very unique not the  not at all selfish and the  probably a little too giving for his butt  always has my best interest at heart has the highest morals of anyone I know would give somebody the shirt off of his back is a genius and so many ways and  I'm pretty lucky I think  that  I'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time I haven't given up on  taking risks and,11
403,"thank you  at the door  hi I'm Ellie  are you okay with this yes  how are you doing today I'm doing really good  I'm from Granada Hills California it's the San Fernando Valley part of Los Angeles  I love the weather I like the diversity in people I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one racer kind of food I love the beaches all the activities you could go do the theme parks aquarium stuff like that museums  this smog  there's a lot of creepy guys  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I've pretty much child around La I've been cross-country and back three times twice with when I was 17  what do you enjoy about  I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live  I want to hear  when I was seventeen I ran away with my boyfriend to Upstate New York to Watertown it was a like a Navy Army kind of town we had an apartment there are it snowed a lot we sold antique Spirit living  awesome  getting calluses pressed houses for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through friend and getting to meet rock stars and hang out I like the private parties  I'm very outgoing I love people  sometimes when I'm feeling  what is the fastest guy  what do you do  am I go to the gym and work out quite a bit I find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going I really notice if I don't work out a couple of days I feel a little more tired than normal and is it helps me feel good  I'm pretty good at it I'm very, I worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to you and you have to remain calm and you know they're the customer so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid cuz the money they're spending so I'm good at resume resolving like consumer complex and stuff on the job  I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and I kind of started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that I didn't know that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean and you know and I wonder like if you're talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is LA  what's something you feel guilty about  I really don't feel guilty about anyting decisions I've made in my life I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass what I'm doing I grew up in church so I haven't gone in years but I still have those values and you know the rules the Ten Commandments and stuff in my head  I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called you know the proper authorities and follow through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code  a few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming early and going back home I decided to move there and I had just started you know this business is doing event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experienced something new or stay and what I was doing  I was I had a degree in Dental Assisting I did that for like a year I didn't like it and then I was sending Communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism  I'm somewhere I'm doing a van work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where I'm controlling my own riding and what's going on instead of writing for someone else  I always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art growing up I really like Connie Chung she was like a Channel 4 newscaster in the eighties and I love Barbara Walters  I was a nerd  relationship with your  tell my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom I never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me  I have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them and phone we just communicate on Facebook or like Twitter  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep so I go right to sleep when I get tired I just go to sleep  how you been doing lately three good energetic I've been motivated to go look for more van work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than I was  I mean it's kind of hard cuz you got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else  I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer the one I know dies  I want to say that I'm just super like oh my God happy all the time but it's like an even Keel that I feel pretty good all the time  I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them Eddie's and I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or group of people that I'm used to I could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adopt  what are some things you wish you could change about you  I want to make more money  I'm over in like second grade the people used to make fun of me cuz I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's were in the highest grades and Lacrosse so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe  stuff like that  very talkative she would just say that I talked to everyone  and I'm very friendly and if you need help that I'll help someone you know  a recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hang out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like chicken in the park and played and it was really nice and they was cool visiting or I didn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again and  I like the area  I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people  I think I pursue it but I think maybe I could put a little more time and day into it  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory  I don't really know anything like  that we want a raise or not happen  okay  is there anything you regret  no I feel good about my choices I made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do than balls rolling and I'm you know getting things done I'm not as big as I want to be but I

grown adults good relationship and  things could be better sometimes it's so difficult pain  staking  have relationships at times  there's a some days I'm  I need time for myself and I would rather

405,essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks  thanks  go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way  hi hello  are you okay with this  yes  okay not too bad  I'm from Chicago South Side  I'm back in 1978 when I was 18  lately not much maybe once every two or three years  compared to the letter A  it's totally different you know horrible weather and  it's just a whole different atmosphere  let's see my mother had moved to Africa  I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la  very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane  number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather  I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety  of people  and now it's my my Homebase you know my friends that are family  that's how I like my family is here now  I guess the small hug earthquakes  traffic  just basic things like that really  I don't currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot  I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and  just fun at the fun of it as well  let's see what one trip I went to England  Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip  so that was a nice variety  I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France  that was fun I'm glad I got to do that  that's great  do you consider yourself more shy  I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child  but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City  I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate  pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level  probably with my husband  and  I can't remember the moment what it was about  okay  tell me about your relationship with you  well when you say my family do you mean  my family from childhood or my current family  okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and  and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship  and then there's the husband which  like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons  and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but  but since we have determined that we need to divorce  we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good  well  I guess our marriage  I wish I had noticed early on that  you know it was like way off from what I thought it was  how do you say oh my God  hardest decision  I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard  well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and  I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because  I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and  and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz  yeah  felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that  I'm sure there's something well  yeah there's some  I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my  recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends  betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and  we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home  and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating  I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young  and  my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say  6 Maybe  maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends  your friends and yet I still have this  bad memory of what her  her mom did to to me  that was about 1:10  about 8 years ago  I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to  in recent years  but obviously it still comes up  anyway that was that  not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing  well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then  you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom  so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so  it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess  well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and  like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever  lately have I been feeling  kind of down  on myself down on life  well I have this pending need for separation / divorce  I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood  and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late  like I missed out on a lot of things  and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff  so I regret that extremely  and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to  divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo  no  yes  well  the first time or or or recently  the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was  in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I  you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset  how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the  knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me  and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know  yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago  no  money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  last time I felt really happy  I don't know I guess maybe  when my children were born  I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice  to have them  that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times  something you did recently that you really enjoy  something I did that I really enjoyed  well  that's the way I am  Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we  we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun  we get to  stay in college get my degree  get therapy trying to become happy  yeah try to figure out things earlier in life  like  yeah  stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like  as soon as the saying goes in the  songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in  having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits  and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself  not much  I guess  just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and  I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people  aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of  having my two daughters  I'm a very loyal  friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating  yeah very loyal very  happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and  yeah I care about people  and I'm interested in people  and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian  yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in  you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them  so what was the question  remember the question  okay  you're welcome by  I did need the tissue one time so that's good  the other sister,17
406,okay  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  are you okay with this yes  I'm doing good  I'm originally from Southern California  I like the downtown Theater District I like the beaches I I like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day  well sometimes I don't like the traffic I don't think there's really too much I don't like about La I really like it like that oh  no I haven't really travel in about 5 years  oh I just haven't been able to travel  I just haven't travel  I like going to new places and seeing things I haven't seen before and if I can like visiting places like landmarks  I want to hear that one of your trips  well the last one I did was San Francisco that wasn't so far but I got to stay in downtown San Francisco and I got to go shopping and I got to get on him the streetcar so that was cool  well I still study I'm studying psychology  well  I decided to go back to school just pretty quickly so I went to Junior College and then when it got close to graduate I knew I want to transfer so  I taking a couple psychology course is not decided I liked it so I just decide to make that my major and I thought I didn't have a lot of math but it had enough math  are you happy  well now that I'm almost done I don't know if I'm going to continue in that area  dream job  well would I wanted initially was to get in the sport psychology but I'm not quite sure that's what I want either  okay  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  well I have to be shy initially but once you get to know me I'm outgoing  what I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver I think I either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on Netflix  like what what does a good movie I like four movies a lot so a lot of right now I'm into martial arts movie with subtitles so  I think I'm pretty good  when was the  you know I know  they're not really long arguments I don't know if there were arguments I know I argue with my boyfriend and he hung up for my face so I don't know why and it got soft pretty quickly so I don't know if it was really that important  when I walked out without saying okay  I can't think of one right now  I think  the hardest decision I probably had to make was moving from will back to California from Oregon  can you tell me about that  but I was really young so I was  19/20 and I was really by myself so that was pretty hard cuz I obviously had to support myself  what made you decide to do that because it was a really really boring in Oregon so I really like the activity here in LA  what's something you feel guilty about  you know I don't really feel guilty about many things  okay  tell me about your relationship with your family  well I don't talk to them that much my dad and my stepmom live in Oregon so I probably talked to on the phone at least once or twice a month and then when I come out here I want to say at least once a year sometimes you can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often and I see them about it but I'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well yeah  what have lots of positive influences I think I'm just regular people are come across you know maybe someone off work with maybe I'll actually my uncle he's a really good positive but he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice  like what about life  you know I don't really think I've had anything that bad happen to me where I just don't  what bothers me so much I have to not think about it  well I can't say pretty easy cuz I work schedule and then I go to school but  I want to go to sleep I sleep really well those long as I have enough you know hours  feeling lately really really happy and good  nope  no  always happy hour yesterday  I'm just happy anytime I talk to my boyfriend or if I go out and do something I'm just happy I got off work I'm happy cuz I'm done for the day I'm just really happy I'm on spring break I'm really happy right now so  awesome  something you did read  oh I haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat but the last activity that I had a lot of fun doing with ice skating in December 10th in downtown LA  is there anything you regret know I don't really have too many regrets I mean whatever happens happens and you know was meant to play out that way  advice cuz you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  well  I guess I would say don't worry too much about the small things  even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and you won't think about it in 6 months from now  okay  I think my best qualities are I'm a happy person I'm a fun person I'm pretty easy to get along with I think most people like me and I'm just a cool person  well I wish I could study more I wish I would study more I wish that I would exercise more and I wish that I think that's it right there  tell me about  I don't think I want to talk about that  okay  what are you most proud of in your life  I don't know I guess I'm just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home I guess that's about the best accomplishment there is  thank you  bye  okay is that you and the other end  all right so you can move back over to that computer will have you do a quick phone service,2
407,"oh so she's like going to be counselor kind of  and then I just press that  and then we just have that again and they're done cool  haikal  are you okay  yes  I'm actually I feel pretty good cuz I I I slept all day yesterday almost I'm usually doing something if not work it's cool if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so I actually didn't have work yesterday and I don't have school on have school on the weekdays so I actually slept probably like 85% of the days I actually feel kind of good but I'm actually kind of tired as well I have other stuff going on but other than that I'm good today  okay  I'm originally from Bakersfield California  really  I'm so late when I was an infant and I'm left here when I was around 3 or 4 and I've been moved I moved back here in 07 and I've been living here ever since  well since I've been here since 07 I've only been back maybe  maybe like  couple why were there at 4 like a summer like in 08 I think I was there for like almost all summer but I don't even back up a couple times and since I've been back here  unfortunately  it compared to La doesn't really compare. I grew up in Sacramento actually I didn't get to tell you I was born in Bakersfield and I lived here anyways I don't know if I did I forgot anyways yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small as to Valley La has all the stuff to do has oceans and his file kinds of located on by a lot of cool places like Vegas and San Diego and what have you not but yeah other than that I miss my friends and stuff that I don't miss like actual City I just missed some of the people that I grew up with  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I can't see your shoes but I don't travel after I've only been out of California like six time so I would like to travel inside  have enough money to do so  I want to be a filmmaker and which I still want to be a filmmaker and I said I was 10 I took Communications and the general that stuff too and took my video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to I'm filmmaking and I have learned a lot of stuff and I still have that knowledge however I haven't really used it since I've been back here in La I did all that stuff in Northern California in Sacramento but and then I transfer switch over to be at the business which I took some classes in that but now I'm actually studying to be an optician and I'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get infield and become an optician so  but I do want to be I still want to be a filmmaker and I'm that still one of my plans and I still actually I got into I'm playing poker 2 years ago and I really like the idea of becoming a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player have it both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of it have to be like a small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere  3 oxygen  I guess I was just trying to find something that it was like it it's like a trade it supposed to private college but it just like specifically trained you into one feel then you just learned that you don't do like your GED and all these other classes like you normally do for like like a major or whatever you're going to do so it just trains you to civically to be auditioning and jump in the field I took it just because I actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe I could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually got my attention to be optician so I'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting so it's fine it's really hard but it's interesting in it and it and it's it's fine  we want to benefit this far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel welcome for what  I'm definitely outgoing however I can be shy sometimes like I'm kind of shy right now because talking to you and your computer and your cartoon or animated or whatever but no usually 98%  I turn on the  hey  but it's the best I've got  I actually was actually kind of funny and I think maybe this might go further some of the poker players to really I've never really talked to any professional poker player to be as far as like I actually playing poker is actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like  stuff in the past or present or future stuff is coming up as far as like I am really would I really do not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kind of like a therapy thing for me cuz I don't like I guess you could say the kind of drug because I don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed our stuff that's happened in the past I just like focus on poker so it's actually kind of relieved and however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so I guess it's kind of like a catch-22 or whatever but yeah so no poker I put like to play basketball I like to watch movies I can go to the beach actually one of the things I like to do is go to the beach cuz it does it makes me feel good but I usually when you go to the beach when it's hot. During the cold season so it's coming up soon so looking forward to that I'm really busy but I'll try to go to the beach because I can't  I'm really good at controlling my temper actually I've only been in like I'm 30 years old I've been in like six fights maybe and all six of them were started by the other person so I've never started a real fight in my whole life like I started fighting a little kid but talking about like a real stuff like what you get past like 13-14 but yeah I know I'm good like every now and then like there's been in the past were like I wasn't able to control it  but as far as I ever being violent or anyting that's never occurred and never would but for the majority of the time yeah I don't have like people do stupid things all the time and I just like Let It Go expect to like I'm on the freeway and stuff but  oh I mean I get about with my ex girlfriend a lot but it was just about really Petty things I guess that maybe we just I think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because we just bumped head too much so obviously she's my ex-girlfriend probably for a reason so  we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend thing  I guess my film  there's a lot of stuff I got to handle differently about  maybe like when I was doing really good when I was younger and I was working for  production assistant for a filmmaker's around where I live in Sacramento so I was doing everything that I want to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot on my stuff together I have my own car mode apartment and then I got involved with like the wrong group of people I guess and kind of tumble down hill from there in like lost everything like our apartment so I just wish that maybe I never got involved with those kind of people that kind of girl ever  because I would probably a pirate my life probably a lot different now however I believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously I think you should also like stuff that happens good or bad  learn from your mistakes so that when it happens again you could not make that mistake our try not to make it as bad yes so you know  I guess  hardest decision  the hardest decision I have ever had the maid would be  I guess you could say I don't really know  can I say that I  maybe like my ex-girlfriend like I couldn't like  stayed with her and I really like it still am in love with her and would like to be with her and miss her but I guess the biggest decision that I had to make was like I know that wasn't like a healthy relationship and I know if we like stay together if we got married or have kids that I don't think would end up working out anyways so I guess the decision the hardest decision would be till like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and not with her so I guess that was a hard really hard decision because I could easily have done it and I guess maybe I would have been happier that way but stressed out and irritable or whatever and other way of having to deal with her iguess deal with each other our relationship so it's really hard still is so I guess that's not choosing to be with someone that I loved and loved me  or whatever so  what was that  I beg your pardon  navad  I understand the first part of that question  oh an event own event okay that can erase  event that I can erase for my memory  IMAX girlfriend I wish I never met her  my first girlfriend in my last girlfriend I wish I never met them cuz we were we were together and love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so I guess both of them  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep extremely I could fall asleep anywhere I actually the other day I broke a record I almost fell asleep standing up which would have been weird because I guess I would have fallen down or something I don't know I just caught myself I guess I was I mean I was really tired but I do a lot of stuff so it's hard for I don't really get that much sleep  as much as I would like but I can sleep when I'm dead or whatever  have they said  I know  no  lately I'm just tired but I'm all right I guess I'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month and a week but it's actually is not I mean I've had worse things happen I mean worst things happening had worse things happen to us  well-known religious person that I'm Catholic I believe in God I know there's a God so obviously even though all of it even devoted people to God regardless of what they are they sometimes stay so I do stay sometimes but definitely last for that long and I know that there is a God and I know that I'll be okay and everything will be okay but you know it's hard to deal with them like I don't really I just keep going and I go to school and work and I just have to keep going I can't give up so I just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of been like sleeping a lot house but I don't go to sleep a lot so I don't know playing poker  playing basketball helps me deal with him hanging out with my friend sometime  I felt really happy on Friday because I went to San Diego for the first time and I didn't it wasn't as cool as I thought it would be but we're like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so I would much rather been free during that time but I wasn't but we had fun it was cool I enjoyed it so yeah I really like that I was at fun and I was happy about going to San Diego for the first time and I am had a good time  a lot of things but I guess I would say like be nicer to like family members know a couple family members that I wish I would have been different to  at the different to not that I was like a horrible but I could have been nicer in some instances that if I didn't know the situation at hand and I would have never like really went out and partied all the time like I did like Highschool different part times of a type I would have just really focused on schooling and stuff them in to the party later would have gotten relationships that I'm sorry I just told myself more basely to be more have more Direction be more focused I guess I stay away from people and unhealthy relationships and healthy people I guess not that I'm the healthiest but yeah I just want it done a lot of stuff different but I don't know if she said earlier but I believe everything happens for a reason  so I guess everything is happening now for reason something to keep going  I guess there's a few that I do have a few that I used to have cuz I have best friends now couple I guess one new one and I've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like 100 ways but I guess they're all probably describe me more as like energetic funny crazy loud silly  smart and I just I guess in general just like entertaining to be around I have  I haven't always been the best bestest best friend but I tried you know my hardest  so that's cool  change myself  I wish I was  I wish I was like 15 pounds lighter  I wish I didn't need  how do I set potatoes I feel like  I feel like I'm I feel like I need to be like in a relationship with a girl but I feel like I wish I didn't have to be like feel like that I needed to have a girl all the time and so I get that, like focus more and I wish that like I didn't need sexual I wasn't always think about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as I do cuz I feel like if I didn't concentrate our have to like be with girls are in a relationship to like well I don't know how to say it but I was saying like there's a guy friends that I know that don't need sex as much as I do and I feel like I need it more than I feel like sometimes that I wish I didn't need as much so maybe I guess I'm addicted to it a little bit more like I can focus on more things other than just I mean I don't just focus on sex but I just feel like if I focused on it if I didn't want it need it or think I need it as much that I could get  step dad in my life  but that sometimes I'm working on that  what am I most proud of  I'm most proud of  almost I guess I guess I'm most proud of working for television station back in Sacramento and working on a lot of them film sets cuz like I I was 16 and I decided I want to be a filmmaker and then two years later or year-and-a-half later you basically I got I started making steps to become a filmmaker and then I ended up working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really really good I'm cinematographer I really good I'm freelancing to Target for those that lives in Sacramento that deal I think so I'm proud that I had a dream and I went for it and I actually ended up doing stuff to go toward my dream that were in my dream so I guess that's one of my biggest accomplishment which was like over 10 years ago but I know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or no  perfect  goodbye  cool",3

could be hard if you don't practice it everyday or if you're not able to quiet your mind however if you meditate for a long time it becomes a practice like going to the trim or drinking any water you can naturally learn to meditate  I think pretty good  when was the  I typically do not argue and I don't remember any instance of arguing with anyone recently  okay  maybe being on the freeway and

409,everything right this is you want to go alone  okay  yeah  okay well  what's up just want to see what they look like to I like to try to be aware of like how I'm answering which means about her it would be okay  okay  okay alright  oh I see okay I got you okay  what was she say okay okay I got you then alright thank you  hi  are you okay with this sure  doing okay  I'm from my la  yeah  I like the weather I like the sports teams like the entertainment  it's pretty much the same you're wrong as far as the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's kind of like a mixed bag and I guess that means I'm kind of used to it by now so be nice to explore other areas I will draw my life having too much traveling so it's a little bit of a kind of a Readiness to it but overall it's okay  okay  I like the computer programming and operations but that's going back to the 70 so it's technology has changed a lot as you can tell the last 40 years that's right that's why I chose my major yeah  I know it's kind of this kind of inquisitive it to get to use your mind you was like your brand-new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know I'm back in the seventies now it's turned into computers but back then I was sort of like something very unique you didn't see too many computers around back then and then programming so it's kind of been to the logical together solving a particular problem he'll come up with a step-by-step Solutions on I guess I'll sort of the analytical Ennis of the year the problem  I know I kind of FaceTime still use computers but I haven't gotten I've been have been in programming for a long time  well I kind of got into an another area kind of divorce Intuit diversion to another area my life this is going back to the late 70s I kind of took another turn and then by the time I got back into it was I kind of got into another field so I never really pursued it to the degree that I wanted to  what's your dream job wow that's a good question I never thought about that ironically actually pretty simple this point in time this is kind of like a little bit depressed and then I am at this point it kind of just wanted to kind of just do a nice relaxing job but I do want it somewhat of a challenge but I don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking it's almost said what I was back in the in the old days you know I just want a nice comfortable relaxing job but I can feel fulfillment on but I don't want to chance of a situation kind of point in my life I just want a nice relaxing job  yeah  oh I would say well the most part shot because once I get going I could be outgoing but I'm shy to begin with and then I X I can listen up and be more outgoing and spend I can take it to the extreme arm talking too much like once upon gates open at the kind of open up too much so I have to like back off now but overall it's a I'm kind of shy as it is a general demeanor  okay  sometime  turn on the fish tank screensaver  yeah  well I listen to music by watch TV  just was what it would do to relax a stressful situation so I can have them stay relaxed Elsa talk to my friends to I'll be around an area about kind of a comfort area where I feel safe I can just dialogue with people so kind of gets me out of my think about my own problems I'm having a kind of just you know focus on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances  I'm pretty good I don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to to explode I think when I was in my younger days I think it was a bit more  had a little bit slight bit of Tampa never had a really bad temper but tempers not really an issue I have to be pretty mellow easy-going  wow that's a good question I'm not sure to be honest  I don't think about that for a long time and to be honest I can't come with an answer on that not really part of my repertoire nothing comes to mind. My head  well  well don't say anything on the way back and made some bad and bad Investments back about 10 years ago  how's more  Charlie like what I'm looking for more trusting of people like that people in like them I thought were expert in their field and I inherited some money I was little bit careless with it and I just kind of had a Vibe you know that nothing would go wrong kind of little bit of night-night tivity and unfortunately some bad financial decision is kind of put me in a bad position for the rest of my life and fortunately he got because of a medical conditions I have talking to rebounding you don't make it all up so I was saved mainly financial and investment decisions that I really regret  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me  wow  that's a tough one  I can't think everything about my head  okay  well I don't really have too much family left the only one I have is my it just me and my uncle and we could we communicate on a regular basis he look but he lives in Clearwater Florida so long we were okay but  he's like it isn't he's in his eighties and I was young my my 50 so we can we do we have kind of small talk and he's kind of concerned about my well-being but it's kind of somewhat of a on a shell of a really deep and that he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation  other than him it's really there's not really anybody else to have I did that part makes me a little depressed cuz I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on a really confide in  it is challenging I don't know why but I do have a medical condition something that might be part of the problem and I have a little bit of BPH so I'll be out of town for the restroom and answer your question to make a long story short it is challenging to get a good night's wake up feeling a little bit tired aching but it is difficult  how deep is feeling lately  well I've been feeling okay I mean  be kind of feeling now actually trying to address issues that I haven't taken responsibility for  but I feel a bit of calmness as of late  have you ever been tagged  no  well I just say yes. The questionnaire and I'm not positive if it was technically diagnosed with it I did take a Venus call the mmph the Minnesota multi-faceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got two questions about my my well being psychologically too and I think some of the answers to the advice that I see a psychologist or psychiatrist I didn't follow that up on that because the philosophical differences but I think I might have a mild case of depression  well you don't like I said I'm just kind of like kind of goat along in life and I'm doing okay but you know highlights passed me by so I haven't really fulfilled my my goal was kind of like alone I'd like to have a girlfriend I don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of tell me who I feel I can get close to and I'm not really in my life right now so what is a certainty I'm having some kind of financial uncertainties so overall not doing as good as I'd like to  okay  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  that's a good one really happy  let me think about that a minute  well actually it wasn't that long ago actually I want you  okay I know that one actually I think I'm going to answer I hope that old lady she was at a trade show it was a Anaheim with natural products Expo so it's pretty nice we we had some nice meals afterwards there's a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples it was an Anaheim some kind of got a chance to get away from LA and  met some interesting people are they were very outgoing they're willing to like having experienced their product or service and I was around people that I work with who I got to socialize with old was pretty happy back then and it was about a month ago  yeah that was  best friend and I really have a best friend but  I would say  I don't know technically I really don't have a best friend so she heard me answer that so I can't really come with an answer to be honest  I like to be conscientious and I do have flaws Mary but I think the overall unconscientious I try to be honest for the most part I'm on the major issues I might you know they would have likewise or you know I'm not perfect I'm not going to come to the serious stuff I tend to be pretty honest I'm a hard worker. Good work ethic  can you be pretty calm for the most part  play regret  what can you elaborate on that  well  I just well just overall I regret them  not be a little more assertive in my earlier  earlier life if I put myself in this position is going to go back to my financial decisions that was sort of that sort of like my albatross in my life I made some bad decisions and unfortunately the kind of pay the price for now so I kind of like sort of like living sort of a popper existence right now which is kind of kind of depressing so I would say that's part of what I regret most of all  advice would you give yourself 10  well I would say to really you don't analyze kind of go with what you really feel  I think I was going with other people's opinion other people's advice I was kind of going away from my basic beingness you don't like the way I really felt like I'd make you aggressive investing which if it turned out good it would be like for like when the lot I would have been well off for the rest of my life but unfortunately it went the opposite way too many eggs in a basket so I kind of regret it going with my gut feeling and let other people influence me and I could by Nature I'm a conservative person so I should really do more conservative Investments another is my life at 10 to be more conservative but I kind of made some aggressive financial decision so that's pretty much  can a local doctor that area as far as what I regret  wow  that's interesting I've been doing a lot of working weekends so well I do like to be profitable to do something where I can actually you don't make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time could you trade shows but I'm not doing that then I'm like maybe watch some men you know I like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game go to a movie go with some friends so just going to kick back but my main primary primary focus will be on earning earning money on the weekends  huh  that's interesting  what's prerogative  I would say that I live by and large all of the wholesome life I would say I never got myself into any kind of really bad  bad advice you know I  I love the pretty hoe salsa my wife I said I'll probably I don't really proud but as far as I stay the course as far as not going down any real deep to speak  okay  my pleasure  that's pretty interesting is it improve your technology on a lot more like you're talking to a live person Siri  it was kind of a little bit more Academy can tell us like a more like a like a video game this looks more like a real person communicates like  return for not trying to deal with her but it was some other guys and I think I know what it was but it was a little bit more  I can't reveal all the details but this is see no more comfortable more natural  yeah,10

411,I was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah  k  okay k  okay when I'm done okay  and please  are you okay with this  pretty good  New York  I moved to LA in the 70s  but I asked you what I lived a lot of different places  I guess every few years but I travel a lot so I've lived in I've lived in Africa is Lyft in Spain Switzerland Hong Kong 2  what do you enjoy about  different cultures food music rituals of everything the smells of colors makes you feel alive  excuse me  one of my trips  I lived in Kenya for about a year I'd say I love horseback riding so when you're viewing other animals when you're kind of Disguise in the scent of a horseshoe can approach the animals a lot closer so it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along you know seeing somebody animals yeah  in Kenya  probably when I went to a  messiah Village and I happen to I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perils that are hand-painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with the Twisted one or not and I happen to enter a Maasai Village for the first time that day and I looked all around in the men were wearing their clothing exactly what the same Twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Maasai and  and then they came back and gave me what appear to be some very large what looks like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have liked Wade my ears straight down and and then gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist in the city now you look proper Maasai  so but I I just I have a lot of fun I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I'm just you feel alive all your senses are completely you know I woken yeah  I think it's not so clear-cut I think a lot of people's are a hybrid of both I mean I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely Brazen and very courageous and other times probably one of my best virtues is I'm very gutsy person so when I really feel passionate about something I Risk Everything To Go Achieve it sometimes I believe that  usually will I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I can make decisions quicker and I told him I said well and that you should case you always have no choice in this is what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and I said not really because it's got wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when I get why she always know what the choice were you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98% chance of failure even if it's a 2% chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield your joy so I always go to that ass tits to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another Choice cuz who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yield to no joy  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not  Departed  you said you put your fish  what do I do when I'm annoyed  I don't want to annoy sometimes like it's because sometimes I can have like it needs to be a little more patient  I guess you really have to put yourself  and somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy  how hard is it  not really I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much cuz you're putting other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from your s different situations I've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is  when was the last time  my sink  last time I argued about something  go try to remember  oh is he goes when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy and something  oh I know what it was  it was somebody who belong to the  Scientology face  I inherited  I inherited possibly of a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I had like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photos sensitive and  I had an you know what episode where was I had a big flare up and I wasn't really feeling well I felt flushed and everything and the scientologists tells me that I needed to be audited and and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware of that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including buddhism's and Scientology believe that things that you have  had in your history sometimes a statue or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you had the power of each person as a god-like or Buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I'm on the verge possibly and I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it as I think when I think I'm on the verge I take the sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would say I would say I would have two good part  you know help the bad part of a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I contradict healing an enzyme when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that she has hers last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but  but I was just I think I'm annoyed and irritated because the scientologists told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had the certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even matter I said of whether he was really took 20 40 courses of whether I've been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years of weather of somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and Benny sitting in a church pew every day doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of  somebody who says they were lighting but it's just the way I guess he kept grabbing his  you know his face down my throat that after while I was pretty patient with a but then who it was so Papa's that I became irritated  especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out him cuz I just didn't want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip cuz you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get hip surgery I mean I believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he flippantly said while you wear a Scientologist believe that past lives can also affect you know what I'm thinking to myself Buddhist of all religions  kind of like well known for being believing in in a cause and effect and past life situations and I found my thought you should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but you know I die you know I I I just didn't you no care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it  but other than that I mean I don't  sometimes to have a little more tact I guess when when in terms of patients  I can think of that right away I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital  I'm sorry  how did you do  my brother was supposed to be the strong and supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and I said well you know he's a medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept me know you know bucking these body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and what kind of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard but you know I was after while the  you know even the Physicians and even the pastor from that particular you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he did his brain function would have been you know legible  that was  tell me about Nevada  I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've  had to block them I really don't know what it is within my makeup which  doesn't make me feel like I need to like I don't keep the I have friends that have on mitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger their hatred or their fear and for some reason I feel blessed that I don't have to like I can't really even think of something that I mean I've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they traumatized me in effecting you know my behavior where I would wear I block at that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason so I really can't think of anything I mean does bad things that happen I know that they are but it's not like I feel like a necessary for me to block them because I've been able to  you know  chaps that sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened  pretty easy I can usually make my sleep by Self sleep in any situation if I have a 1 hour flight to San Francisco I could just kind of lean against the window where the pillow have a blanket over and even on our flight pass out before the plane is even taking off from the ground so I can I have literally when I've had little sleep and I very at high energy so I don't really need that much sleep but say like if I'm in Africa and I  Bobby potholes unpaved Road and I still need side I need a few moments of sleep I was just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say I think I should take a nap for 15 minutes go like this and through the jostling I could just take a nap for 15 minutes so I don't really have that problem  okay pretty okay me and I could deal without the skin flare-ups but you know from the photosensitivity and all that but other than that I'm pretty good spirits  have I ever studied what  I can still couldn't hear you I'm sorry  have you noticed any changes in your  I've ever studied changes in my behavior was the word  enough  I know I just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having great meal laughing just having a good time listening music  designing your address  regret about my entire life you man or are you talking about just recently or what are you talkin about  you know what's funny I find that lot of the negative experiences that are in my life that have happened are falsely been  opens up experiences that are  that are also great that I have not overlooked root sample I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my old my whole savings ever had to start all over again and sometimes people say to me like are you sure you're okay or are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you want to seek revenge if I was there cuz my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way and he still essentially my whole life savings essentially in a way and tea what got sent to prison or the FBI was involved in her pulse involved I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth and  but you know if I hadn't get involved hadn't gotten involved with him and business I wouldn't have had there a lot of Rich experiences and I think sometimes the reason why  I don't know why I'm such a positive person but for some reason I'm able to this not that I'm purposely trying to I do see the positive this and even harmful situations I wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish Drummond lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner end up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences a different friendships that I developed during that. Of time and in a way it was a total different life a different world that that would do you know that I would have never  have the chance you know to live through if I had not been filed in my ear but of course it cost me financially and but then again I've always been a type of person who your money isn't everything and I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it so there you go and resemble one of my favorite  times in my life probably when I lived in Kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad Vision or maybe looking living in mud dong Huts or something and living very primitively I mean it's not like that at all that I and you think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that I mean actually and I'd really didn't have you know that much been many material Goods to the time I mean I had the blast I had probably been one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya  that's so good to hear  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  the same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16  to live your life with passion and again like shoes the way I was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions. Wise what will give you a sense of on wonderment what will make you give you Joy and you have to its regardless what the percentage are even if you only have a 1% chance of success you have to go to sad cuz that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life  Otterbein your life  the fact that I've a two-year to that and been Brazen whatever you want to say have the balls of cuts / like a harness to go ahead and follow my passions and you know I guess people called me somebody strong decisions usually this isn't sorry when you where you remain unscathed usually don't heal Joy that's just Murphy's Law Office just the way it is  okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  hi,0
